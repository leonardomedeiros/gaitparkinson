  Review                   = {------------------------------------------------------ Resumo ------------------------------------------------------ Para mover o tratatamento de saúde do hospital para as tecnologias assistidas em casa é vital conhecer como as tecnologias podem ser utilizadas. Baseado em pequisa qualitativa esse artigo busca encontrar o engajamento dos envolvidos nas atividades de assistência médica e suas rotina normal e como essas pessoas conseguem adotar a tecnologia de assistência médica. Nessa pesquisa foram explorados cinco fatores: objetos, atividades, lugares característica da da e a colaboração. Considerações ------------- O artigo é da área de HCI, e busca fazer uma análise qualitativa de como 4 pacientes fazem o tratamento de sua doença crônica. O autor faz a distinção em uma matriz de 4 tipos de pacientes: Visíveis e invisíveis; segmentados e integrados. Para o autor existem os pacientes que fazem o tratamento de forma invisível ou escondendo a doença e outros que o estado é tão grave ou não se importam e deixam seu tratamento à vista de todos. Os pacientes segmentados são aqueles que conseguem conciliar o seu tratamento com outra atividade e o integrado é aquele que está em constante tratamento. O autor reconhece que devido ao estado de saúde é bem provável que o mesmo paciente vá migrando de um ponto a outro. Geralmente os pacientes mais críticos são visíveis e integrados, como no caso de Poul, paciente pesquisado que possui 65 anos com diabetes a vários e já anda de cadeira de rodas devido as complicações. O autor trata nesse artigo do self-care para ele isso significa que a pessoa é tratada de fora da clínica médica, para ele isso não é uma tarefa individual mas sim de todos os envolvidos como familiares por exemplo. Por conta disso há uma distribuição de responsabilidade entre os provedores de asssistência médica, pacientes e demais envolvidos no tratamento. Método de pesquisa ------------------ O foco da pesquisa foi as tecnologias assistivas na saúde e seu gerenciamento em casa. Esse artigo não se preocupa com as tecnologias utilizadas mas sim na análise do próprio usuário. Foram analisados 3 pacientes: - Karen- segundo a classificação do autor ela é segmentada e invisível: 63 anos, defeito no coração desde 2001 e elevado risco de ter aneurisma cerebral. Seu esposo faz o acompanhamento baseado em anti-coagulante. É facilmente gerenciado pois uma vez na semana ela faz exame de INR, ajustando o medicamente de acordo com o resultado. Contudo a paciente possui vaidade e às vezes não segue o tratamento à risca devido a suas atividades. Eventualmente seu esposo a lembra de tomar a medicação. Ela consegue deixa o tratamento invisível aos demais, poupando inclusive outros familiares a respeito de noticias. - Maja- devido ao seu trabalho ela gerencia a doença de forma invisível e integrada a suas atividades e rotinas diárias. Maja é conhecida do autor desde um projeto que ela participou de gerenciamento de diabetes durante a gravidez. Maja possui 30 anos, é professora e possui diagnostica a diabetes tipo I a alguns anos. É casada com Thomas. Maja precisa tomar insulina antes de dormir para regular os níveis de glicose. Com a gravidez ela nunca tinha passado por um nível de glicose tão baixo. Maja eventualmente esquece do tratamento e fica com os níves bastante desregulados. Preocupando Thomas que sabe o quanto prejudica a criança que vai nascer. Poul- 65 anos, estado avançado de diabetes. Participa de um projeto de monitoria da pressão do sangue e ingestão de medicamentos. Ele mora no primeiro andar mas não pode pegar elevador, logo sai de casa uma vez na semana, justamente por conta do tratamento. Esse paciente está num estágio que não tem como ficar invisível e devido a suas complicações não tem como não ser integrado. Poul não possui convívio social e seus familiares moram em outro país, eventualmente conversa com os filhos ao telefone. Poul recebe diversos profissionais em sua residência. Bastante atento com o gerenciamento da diabetes a mantém os registros meticulosamente. Possuindo integrado o tratamento da diabetes a outras atividades. A sua rotina está toda envolta da doença. =============================== Fatores de pesquisa explorados: =============================== Objetos ------- As ferramentas, sensores, glucograma e demais objetos de tratamento de saúde são bastante estigmatizados, e conseqüentemente existe toda uma cultura que por questão de vaidade, sociedade ou outro motivo venham a atrapalhar seu uso e conseqüenemente impactar no tratamento. Os pacientes informaram que o quanto as tecnologias pudessem se tornar invisíveis seria melhor. Para eles isso os daria muita qualidade de vida e o sentimento que sentiriam é q estavam com uma vida normal, melhorando assim sua auto-estima e conseqüentemente o tratamento seria mais eficaz. Atividades ---------- Similaremente aos objetos as atividades relatadas durante o tratamento são afetadas por questões culturais, de acordo com a atividade desempenhada, instante de tratamento e o escopo da própria atividade. Algumas atividades relatadas no tratamento da doença por vezes demandam mais esforço do que outros, afetando em determinados momentos a própria atividade. A análise de glicose no sangue por exemplo, durante a gravidez MAJA tem que reavaliar o nível e ajustar com insulina a cada uma hora e meia. Contudo nesse interstício ela esta em sala de aula e ela não quer interromper para fazer a medição. Maja escolheu segmentar seu tratamento nessa situação quando ela geralmente busca a integração. Karen faz a medição uma vez por semana, o que permite que ela tenha total integração com suas atividades. Localização ----------- Como descrito anteriormente a residência está estruturada para ser parte pública e parte privada. Poul busca arranjar seus objetos Característica da Doença ------------------------ Quando uma pessoa adoece e faz o atendimento em casa, é difícil aceitar a doença detro de casa. O seriedade da doença afeta em como a pssoa vai integrar ou segmentar a doença. Colaboração ----------- Todos os três casos demonstrou que o tratamento da saúde é uma atividade colaborativa, envolvendo várias pessoas. ----------------- Preceitos dos artigos: 1. Movimento crescente de levar os pacientes de casa ao hospital. 2. Crescimento da ocorrência de doenças crônicas e conseqüentemente uma necessidade de prestar assistência em casa. 3. Pontos positivos ----------------- 1. O autor faz uma exploração em como as pessoas gerenciam a doença em casa incluindo como as tecnologias de assistência médica são empregadas e organizadas no dia a dia. 2. O artigo busca integrar a vida das pessoas nas atividades de assistência médica e nas atividades que não dizem respeito à assistência médica. Trabalhos futuros ----------------- - Desenvolvimento de tecnologias de healthcare em casa para a casa. - Explorar o papel da severidade da doença e a dependência das tecnologias para integrar ou segmentar o tratamento.

Based on qualitative studies we find that people engage in elaborate boundary work to maintain the order of the home when managing disease and adopting new healthcare technology. In our analysis we relate this boundary work to two continuums of visibility-invisibility and integration-segmentation in disease management. We explore five factors that affect the boundary work: objects, activities, places, character of disease, and collaboration. Furthermore, the processes are explored of how boundary objects move between social worlds pushing and shaping boundaries. From this we discuss design implications for future healthcare technologies for the home.},

A segurança é um fator de extrema importância na assistência médica, pois todos os registros médicos devem ser privados. Tratamentos de segurança para os sistemas de pervasive healthcare: Confidencialidade: protege os dados de pessoas não autorizadas entre paciente e médico ou no armazenamento. O paciente deve ter todo o direito de saber quem irá acessar suas informações, qual o propósito e onde elas serão mantidas. Autenticação: A autenticação provê uma forma de estabelecer a identidade e segurança entre as informações do transmissor e receptor. É possível verificar os dados do paciente armazenados, através de redes sem fio. Integridade: Os registros médicos podem ser encriptados para proteger de acesso não autorizado, mas mesmo assim os dados podem ser violados e corrompidos na busca de acessar a informação. Controle de Acesso: Alguns componentes usados para registrar os dados médicos do paciente são implantados em seu corpo, e são conectados através de rede sem fio ou tecnologia bluetooth. Logo deve haver um controle de acesso a esses componentes, prevenindo acesso não autorizado. Armazenamento de dados seguro, O armazenamento de dados seguro contra acesso não autorizado é importante. Devendo haver um nível de segurança definido para a camada de armazenamento dos dados. --------- O artigo fala que como trabalho futuro irá criar um ambiente de segurança para as aplicações pervasivas.},

The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of an organizing framework based on principles of learning theory to classify and rank exergames according to embedded behavior change principles. Behavioral contingencies represent a key theory-based game design principle that can be objectively measured, evaluated, and manipulated to help explain and change the frequency and duration of game play. Case examples are presented that demonstrate how to code dimensions of behavior, consequences of behavior, and antecedents of behavior. Our framework may be used to identify game principles which, in the future, might be used to predict which games are most likely to promote adoption and maintenance of leisure time physical activity.},

Technological advances have made determination of genetic predisposition to disease possible and have gained wide use in oncology to develop more effective and individualized treatment strategies{\textemdash}Personalized Medicine. There is growing interest in the application of these genetic tests in predicting risk for complex genetic diseases; even, direct-to-consumer tests are increasingly becoming available and affordable. CH has shown great potential in collecting phenotypic data, which can be overlaid on genomic data to deliver a more precise and personalized preventive care that better engages patients. The goal of a CH program that uses genetic data would be to monitor individuals{\textquoteright} risk factors and predict the onset of CD. This prediction would be coupled with coaching to delay or prevent the onset of disease. However, the challenge remains that many CDs are due to complex interaction between genes and modifiable environmental risk factors that are still under-studied. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.

  Abstract                 = {Proliferation of small handheld devices and wireless technologies has kindled the phenomenon of pervasive computing. Healthcare, being a prime concern for every society, has been considered as an ideal setting for deployment of this technology. Pervasive healthcare aims to improve patient independent living and quality of life and pay special attention to issues of security, privacy, transparency and ease of use. From its very nature of being open and dynamic, the pervasive environment has been challenged with security and privacy related issues with regards to collaborative information sharing. In this paper, we present some of the privacy challenges that arise when designing pervasive healthcare environments and discuss addressing some of these issues in a home based patient monitoring system. Specifically, we cover privacy violation through individual healthcare information availability and information leakage through context-aware services.},

  Review                   = {Towards privacy protection in pervasive healthcare ------------------------------------------------- O termo pervasive health care é utilizado para descrever a integração entre o uso da computação pervasiva na assistência médica. A necessidade de sistemas de assistÊncia médica se deve ao fato de: profissionais da saúde precisam de mobilidade além de terem que compartilhar suas experiência e informações com os demais profissionais responsáveis por determinado paciente. Nos últimos anos houve um crescimento no atendimento médico domiciliar. Em todos os casos há uma necessidade de acesso ubíquo às informações do paciente. É sabido que na relação médico-paciente existe um pacto de confidencialidade. Logo se estamos num ambiente de computação ubíqua onde a informação é trafegada através de ambientes sem-fio essa a securidade dessa informação pode ficar comprometida. Os sistemas de assistência médica, ficam na barreira da confidencialidade da informação e compartilhamento da mesma, visto que os médicos devem compartilhar opniões e status do pacientecom outros profissionais da área, para que haja um diagnóstico correto. Por esse motivo faz-se necessário o uso de um gerenciador de confidencialidade[31]. Nesse artigo o autor descreve, dois possíveis violações de privacidade: atacar os registros individuais dos pacientes, ou violar todo o contexto da informação através de vazamento de informação. A primeira corrobora com o fato de quando e como a informação deve ser preservada, quem são os donos da informação, quem deve implantar os meios de proteção da informação. A segunda se deve ao fato de acessar toda a base de dados do sistema. O autor cria 4 possíveis cenários de violação da informação: Cenário 1: Paciente com problema de pressão alta, prefere estar em cas em detrimento a um hospital. Médico concorda que tratá-lo não é perigoso desde que haja um nível de supervisão, até ele voltar a sua vida normal. A computação pervasiva iraá permitir que o paciente instale um sistema monitor em sua casa. O sistema irá monitorá-lo diariamente, e armazenar todas suas informações em arquivos de log para ser avaliado pelo médico no futuro. Problemas, O paciente é dono de suas informações e pode prover acesso para outras pessoas. Ele não deve possuir acesso para modificar as informações. Cenário 2: O sistema pervasivo de informações médicas fica instalado na casa do paciente, e qualquer pessoa pode entrar na casa e pode ter acesso. Logo para resolver os problemas de segurança é necessário haver mecanismos de autênticação para permitir ou negar o acesso as informações. Cenário 3: Um médico realiza as medições no pacientes e por motivos de tratamento o médico não deseja que o paciente tenha acesso as próprias informações. Então, é permitido que o médico negue o acesso à informação? Cenário 4: Uma enfermeira é apontada para tomar conta do paciente. Ela precisa de acesso a todo histórico de informação do paciente, contudo não possui acesso de visualização. E o médico que poderia liberar essa informação não está presente. Mesmo que o paciente libere a informação, esta pode ser de propriedade do médico, o qual não concordaria em disponibilizr o acesso. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Dificuldades encontradas na Pervasive Healthcare: Violação de Privacidade As violações de privacidade às vezes ignoradas nos modelos pervasivos, deve ser tratada com muito cuidado no que se refere a sistemas de assistência médica. 1- Divulgação de informações indesejadas Aqui nos referimos ao direito à privacidade. Informações médicas são direitos adquiridos inclusive por leis federais, ficando a indagação quando e como a informação deve ser protegida. 2. Prevenção do vazamento de informação através do contexto Os sistemas de healthcare primam pela informação contextual condendo detalhas como localidade, horário de acontecimento dos eventos. Isso viola alguns dos direitos à privaciade individual. Divulgação de informações indesejadas -------------------------------------- Nos Estados Unidos as leis federais garatem a privacidade das informações no sistema de saúde. Os novos métodos de transações eletrônicas permitem a porteção a securança e confidencialidade das informações médicas. Planos de saúde e sistemas públicos conduzem seus acertos financeiros eletrônicamente.},

  Abstract                 = {The use of wireless sensor networks (WSN) in healthcare applications is growing in a fast pace. Numerous applications such as heart rate monitor, blood pressure monitor and endoscopic capsule are already in use. To address the growing use of sensor technology in this area, a new field known as wireless body area networks (WBAN or simply BAN) has emerged. As most devices and their applications are wireless in nature, security and privacy concerns are among major areas of concern. Due to direct involvement of humans also increases the sensitivity. Whether the data gathered from patients or individuals are obtained with the consent of the person or without it due to the need by the system, misuse or privacy concerns may restrict people from taking advantage of the full benefits from the system. People may not see these devices safe for daily use. There may also possibility of serious social unrest due to the fear that such devices may be used for monitoring and tracking individuals by government agencies or other private organizations. In this paper we discuss these issues and analyze in detail the problems and their possible measures.},

  Review                   = {Applications of wireless sensor networks focused on monitoring the health status of patients have been in demand and various projects are in the development and implementation stages [4, 6, 9]. Sensor networks in healthcare application scenario are shown in Fig. 1. As seen in Fig. 2, the growth of WSN is rapid and fast. The projected sales of sensors are going to increase rapidly. Similarly Fig. 3 shows the world revenue forecast and growth rate for healthcare, medical and biometrics markets. We can see that sensor networks have a great future ahead with tremendous growth rate. Sensor networks applications in healthcare have potential for large impacts [18]. These can be realized through real-time, continuous vital monitoring to give immediate alerts of changes in patient status. The data can also be relayed to the hospital or correlate with patient records and so on. Home monitoring applications for chronic and elderly patients which can be used to collect periodic or continuous data and be uploaded to a physician and can allow long-term care and trend analysis. It can also reduce length of hospital stay. Manual tracking of patient status is difficult. Collection of long-term databases of clinical data can be used in future diagnosis. There are concerns of health hazards for the implanted sensor devices. The above concerns have far reaching social implications. The social implications and issues that are directly related to the above mentioned application scenarios can be categorized into three major areas— 1. security 2. privacy and 3. legal issues. In this paper, we discuss the security and privacy issues of wireless sensor networks application within healthcare perspective. Some of the major indoor/outdoor application projects are mentioned here - HealthGear [12] It is a product of Microsoft Research. It consists of a set of physiological sensors connected via Bluetooth to a cell phone. It is basically a wearable real-time health system for monitoring and analyzing physiological signals. - MobiHealth [24] It is a mobile healthcare project funded by the European Commission. It allows patients to be fully mobile while undergoing continuous health monitoring by utilizing UMTS and GPRS networks. - Ubimon [26] It is from the Department of Computing, Imperial College, London. The aim of this project is to address the issues related to using wearable and implantable sensors for distributed mobile monitoring. Two areas under consideration are the management of patients with arrhythmic heart disease and the follow-up monitoring of post operative care in patients who have had surgery. - CodeBlue [20] It is a research project at Harvard University, US. It integrates sensor nodes and other wireless devices into a disaster response setting. It is designed to work across various network densities and a wide range of wireless devices. From a tiny small sensor mote to more powerful devices such as PDSs, PCs can be combined in CodeBlue. - eWatch [7] It is a wearable sensor and notification platform developed for context aware computing research. It fits into a wrist watch form making it highly available, instantly viewable, and socially acceptable. eWatch provides tactile, audio and visual notification while sensing and recording light, motion, sound and temperature. ----------------- O autor mostra uma tabela comparando medical Ban e general Ban. Um ponto interessante é que a segurança deve ser forte exceto para casos de emergência. ------------------- IEEE 802.15.6 also known as Task Group 6 (or TG6) was formed in November 2007 to address the issues and standardize WBAN. The call for proposal was issued in January 2009 and heard till May 2009. The standard intends to address both medical/healthcare applications and other non-medical applications with diverse requirements [5]. The MAC layer in the standard intends to define short range, wireless communication in and around the body area. The standard aims to support a low complexity, low cost, ultra-low power and highly reliable wireless communication for use in close proximity to, or inside, a human body (but not limited to humans) to satisfy an evolutionary set of entertainment and healthcare products and services. Security issues are major concern raised by most authors. Privacy issue or other social implications are not discussed extensively regarding this field. Security Issues ----------------------- People have different perspective regarding security and hence it is defined in many ways. In general words, security is a concept similar to safety of the system as a whole. The communications in sensor networks applications in healthcare are mostly wireless in nature. This may result in various security threats to these systems. These threats and attacks could pose serious problems to the social life of an individual who is using the wireless sensor devices. Security issues in healthcare applications of sensor networks have been always part of active research. Security issues in general wireless sensor networks are a major area of research in recent times. Some works include [16, 17]. Similarly many people such as [5, 8, 11] have specifically addressed security issues with respect to healthcare applications. The security issues can be divided into two broad levels: system security and information security. Similarly vital data transmission from WBAN networks through GPRS or similar networks can be stolen by eavesdropping. People with bad intent may use the information for harmful activities. The attacks which can occur in any healthcare system using wireless sensor networks are shown in Table 2. a. Data modification - The attacker can delete or replace part or all of eavesdropped information and send the modified information back to original receiver to achieve some illegal purpose. b. Impersonation attack—If an attacker eavesdrops a wireless sensor node’s identity information, it can be uses to cheat the other nodes. c. Eavesdropping—For the open features of wireless channel used by sensor networks, any opponent can intercept radio communications between the wireless nodes freely and easily. d. Replaying—The attacker can eavesdrop a piece of valid information and resend it to original receiver after a while to achieve same purpose in different case. Authors in [28] argued that in the light of modern concepts of security, the safety should accompany the availability, scalability, efficiency and the quality parameters of inter-node communication. Security threats should include all aspects of the network and its applications. a) System Security i) Administrative Level Security ii) Physical Level Security iii) Technical Level Security b) Information security a. Data Encryption b. Data Integrality c. Authentication d. Freshness Protection Conclusion ----------------- In this paper we tried to raise the concerns of major social implications like privacy and security. General public should also be made aware of the benefits and implications so that they are better prepared. Rules and regulations like that of cyber laws and existing health regulations should be formalized and implemented.},

  Review                   = {The pervasive healthcare systems provide rich contextual information and alerting mechanisms against odd conditions with continuous moni- toring. This minimizes the need for caregivers and helps the chronically ill and elderly to survive an independent life, besides provides quality care for the babies and little children whose both parents have to work. Dados: One of the major challenges of the world for the last decades has been the continuous elderly population increase in the developed countries. Pop- ulation Reference Bureau [2] forecasts that in the next 20 years, the 65-and-over population in the developed countries will be nearly 20% of the overall population. Motivação: One promising application in that area is the integration of sensing and consumer electronics technologies which would allow people to be constantly monitored. In-home pervasive networks may assist residents and their caregivers by providing continuous medical monitoring, memory enhancement, control of home appliances, medical data access, and emergency communication. Researchers in computer, networking, and medical fields are working together in order to make the broad vision of smart healthcare possible. The importance of integrating large-scale wireless telecommunication technologies such as 3G, Wi-Fi Mesh, and WiMAX, with telemedicine has already been addressed by some researchers. Outras Tecnologias: Further improvements will be achieved by the coexistence of small-scale personal area technologies like radio frequency identification (RFID), Bluetooth, ZigBee, and wireless sensor networks, together with large-scale wireless networks to provide context-aware applications Monitoramento Contínuo Permitirá: Given the importance of the subject, there are already several applications and prototypes on the subject. For example, some of them are devoted to continuous monitoring for cognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s or similar cognitive diseases. Some focus on fall detection, posture detection and location tracking and others make use of biological and environmental sensors to identify patients’ health status. Benefícios e Considerações de Design para Sistemas de Monitoramento para Healthcare In healthcare applications, a real-time system is actually a soft real-time system, in which some latency is allowed [13]. Identifying emergency situations like heart attacks or sudden falls in a few seconds or even minutes will suffice for saving lives considering that, without them these conditions will not be identified at all. Together with the mature and also inexpensive RFID technology, the costs for pervasive healthcare systems are within the affordable range for many people. In Caregiver’s Assistant [14], inexpensive RFID tags are placedon household object and the systems precision can be in- creased at very low costs, by tagging more objects with these RFID tags. Most of the existing solutions include one or more types of sensors carried by the patient, forming a Body Area Network (BAN), and one or more types of sensors deployed in the environment forming a Personal Area Network (PAN). The emergency situations produce alerts by the application and these alerts and other health status information can be reached via mo- bile devices like laptop computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and smart phones. The overview of a simple wireless sensor network application scenario is depicted in Fig. 1. Possíveis Usuários: Children: this group consists of young people who are not capable of taking care of themselves like babies, Elderly and chronically ill: this group includes the chronically ill people who have cognitive difficulties or other medical disorders related with heart, respiration, etc. Caregivers: this group is comprised of the parents and the baby-sitters of the children group and also the caregivers and other care network of the elderly and the chronically ill. Healthcare professionals: these are the professional caregivers like physicians and other medical staff who are responsible from the constant health status monitoring of the elderly and the chronically ill people and are capable of giving the immediate response in case of an emergency situation. COLOCAR A TABELA 1. Considerações de Design Body Area Network Subsystem The Body Area Network Subsystem is the ad hoc sensor network and tags that the children and the elderly carry on their body. The RFID tags, ElectroCardioGram (ECG) sensors, and accelerometers worn by the patient, are example components of the body area network. LER ----- Zhou et al. propose a three layer network structure for a pervasive medical supervision system based on wireless sensor networks [86]. The first layer is the medical sensor layer providing information such as the oximetry, the heart rate/pulse and the blood pressure. The medical sensors form a star schema network with a gateway node elected by either a self-organizing protocol or manual configura- tion. The second layer provides reliable transmission. If the patient is at home, the physiological data is transferred to one of the nearest wireless nodes that are emplaced in the house. These nodes not only relay the data to the PC with an Internet connection in a multi-hop manner but also provide contextual data such as temperature, and the patient’s video/picture in emergency situations. When the patient is outside, the relay mission is accomplished by a mobile phone or a PDA device. The third layer of the system is responsible for the aggregation of physiological data in a remote medical center for analysis and providing feed-back data back to the patient through a mobile phone, a PDA or web services. Another example is the Baby Glove [87] which consists of two integrated sensor plates placed on infant’s upper torso, which contain a temperature sensor and electrodes that monitor the infant’s pulse rate and hydration. The device is comprised of two motes. One is connected to the infant’s clothing and the other to a base station computer. The first mote collects the vital sign information coming from the sensors and transmits them wirelessly to the second mote which is connected to the base station computer for processing. If the vital signs are over the limits, the caregivers are alerted. LISTENse is a prototype that enables the hearing impaired to perceive the critical sound information like doorbell or smoke alarm. It is comprised of at least two wireless sensor network motes. There are also some studies for identification of complications of some diseases such as epilepsy seizure. AWARENESS [90] is an example context-aware health application that is designed to detect and react to epilepsy seizures. In a neurological body area network prototype, the ECG data captures an epilepsy seizure; however, without the context information the change in the heart rate cannot be reliably attributed to an epilepsy seizure since it may be due to motion.

  Review                   = {Este estudo teve como objetivo analisar os efeitos do biofeedback na estimulação da movimentação de ombro em idosa com parkinsonismo. Foi aplicado por um período de quatro (04) sessões, associado aos exercícios tradicionais de Terapia Ocupacional, o método de biofeedback por meio do aparelho Biofeed®. Em consequência dos sinais e sintomas clínicos citados anteriormente, com especial atenção a bradicinesia, verifica-se que uma reduzida velocidade dos movimentos voluntários assim como reduzida amplitude de movimento do membro solicitado para realizar o movimento. Assim, os parkinsonianos necessitam de esforço mental e maior gasto de energia para realizar suas atividades. A bradicinesia é o sintoma mais incapacitante da DP, pois com a lentidão e a necessidade de maior tempo para realização das tarefas, os indivíduos acabam se tornando dependentes de cuidadores 2 . A tradicional atuação da reabilitação física com parkinsonistas tem sido focalizada em ensinar aos pacientes estratégias para compensar os sintomas da patologia. O uso de dicas externas e de estratégias cognitivas foi considerado a opção principal no tratamento com essa população. Assim, estes indivíduos são instruídos a processar conscientemente as informações que estão envolvidas em um movimento 8 . O biofeedback tem se mostrado um poderoso instrumento para o ajustamento (adaptação e readaptação) das estratégias motoras de pessoas com algum déficit neurológico. Antes da aplicação do biofeedback foram realizados os seguintes procedimentos: mensuração da amplitude articular do ombro (direito e esquerdo) no movimento de abdução, por meio de um goniômetro da marca Cescor; avaliação da força muscular de acordo com Kendall e familiarização com o procedimento. A melhora no controle motor pelo sistema de biofeedback pode ser explicada pelo fato que conforme os indivíduos encontram dificuldades em desenvolver estratégias de atenção seletiva, é necessário facilitar a aprendizagem motora direcionando o foco da atenção, o uso das dicas de aprendizagem é uma maneira eficiente de promover a seletividade da atenção, pois assim, a aprendizagem motora é favorecida através do reforço simples, específico e direcionado aos pontos críticos da tarefa a ser aprendida Diante do exposto acima concluiu-se que, o estudo foi de extrema importância, onde através do instrumento BioFeed® podemos verificar os benefícios na melhora da amplitude de movimento de membros superiores, bem como, a frequência e velocidade de realização destes movimentos, que obteve grande auxílio na preservação das capacidades funcionais da paciente dentro das limitações impostas pela doença. Outros aspectos positivos foram o fator motivacional e cognitivo. Ao comparar os valores obtidos na primeira sessão com a última sessão para ambos os membros superiores, percebe-se que ocorreu aumento da amplitude de movimento articular, de 120° para 140° no ombro direito e de 130° para 140° no ombro esquerdo, com a aplicação do biofeedback (Tabela 1). DISCUSSÃO Os resultados obtidos mostram que apesar do número reduzido de sessões, ocorreu melhora na amplitude de movimento articular e do controle motor da paciente. Estes resultados não corroboram com estudo realizado com pacientes com Doença de Parkinson e Alzheimer 10,11 . Os autores encontraram que nos estágios iniciais da doença de Parkinson com a ausência do feedback visual a programação e performance motora foi semelhante aos do grupo controle. No entanto quando fornecido o feedback visual houve diminuição da velocidade e da fase de transporte do movimento dos pacientes com Parkinson quando comparados ao grupo controle. Os autores sugerem que esses resultados podem ter decorrido da necessidade de treino portempo mais prolongado com os pacientes com Parkinson, como do fato que o feedback visual pode induzir os pacientes a mudanças de estratégias agindo de forma a distrair o paciente e prejudicar sua performance motora ao invés de auxiliá-lo.},

Automatic on-body device localization ensures correctness and accuracy of measurements in health and medical monitoring systems. In addition, it provides opportunities to improve the performance and usability of ubiquitous devices. Our technique uses accelerometers to capture motion data to estimate the location of the device on the user’s body, using mixed supervised and unsupervised time series analysis methods. We have evaluated our technique with extensive experiments on 25 subjects. On average, our technique achieves 89% accuracy in estimating the location of devices on the body. In order to study the feasibility of classification of left limbs from right limbs (e.g., left arm vs. right arm), we performed an analysis, based on which no meaningful classification was observed. Personalized ultraviolet monitoring and wireless transmission power control comprise two immediate applications of our on-body device localization approach. Such applications, along with their corresponding feasibility studies, are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {Designing security mechanisms such as privacy and access control for medical sensor networks is a challenging task; as such systems may be operated very frequently, at a quick pace, and at times in emergency situations. Understandably, clinicians hold extra unproductive tasks in low regard, and experience from user workshops and observations of clinicians at work on a hospital ward show that if the security mechanisms are not well designed, the technology is either rejected altogether, or they are circumvented leaving the system wide open to attacks [1]. Our work targets the problem of designing wireless sensors to be both secure and usable by exploring different solutions on a fully functional prototype platform. In this paper, we present an Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) based protocol, which offers fully secure sensor set-up in a few seconds on standard (Telos) hardware. We evaluate this protocol’s time and energy consumption, and its impact on the battery lifetime.},

  Review                   = {In this paper, we present an Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) based protocol, Several experimental sensor network platforms have emerged in recent years targeted at clinical use, but only few consider the importance of security issues such as privacy and access control, which can have a huge impact on usability. Existem vários trabalhos de aplicação de redes sensores para monitoramento clínico, porém somente alguns consideram a impertância dos problemas de segurança e prviacidade e controle de acesso, os quais possuem alto impacto de usabilidade. Cálculos que podem ser realizados em frações de segundo em PCs, podem levar vários segundos ou até mesmo minutos se forem realizados nos sensores. Os maiores problemas podem ser a latencia da interface, demora dos cálculos, demanda da rede, infraestrutura de rede e servidores indisponíveis. Os autores rejeitam qualquer solução de sensores que necessitem interferência do departamento de ti do hospital. Os sensores devem estar prontos diretamente da fábrica. Trabalhos Relacionados ------------------------------------ Projeto CodeBlue: os desenvolvedores não incluíram nenhum mecanismo de segurança ou autenticação na sua proposta. Several public key cryptography (PKC) implementations for sensor networks have appeared in recent years. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) currently seems the most promising method. One of the most optimised implementation for TinyOS is TinyECC [8], which can perform the basic ECC point multiplication in less than 2 seconds on the MSP430x1 micro-controller (MCU) family found on the Tmote Sky sensor nodes. Conceitos Fundamentais --------------------------------------- Sensor nodes are organised in groups around patients in a 1- to-1 relationship. In order to establish the various (symmetric) keys necessary for wireless communication in the medical sensor network, a few PKC based configuration change protocols are used whenever a (clinical) user configures the network: • Add a new sensor to a patient. • Remove a sensor from a patient. • Change patient property (e.g. move to another hospital). Como mencionado anteriormente os sensores não podem ser reprogramados usando qualquer tecla. Antes disso, o sensor deve saber em quem confiar e comunicar após ser ligado [10]. Descrição do Protocolo ------------------------------------ For the protocol, we use elliptic curve domain parameters over Fp (p, a, b, G, n, h) given by secp160r1 [12]. We also use a cryptographic hash function, H, described later. All nodes on a patient share a public group-id and a private group-key used for internal group communication, such as property change dissemination. This key is created by the first member of the group in the bootstrap protocol described below, and is never changed. Of course this implies, that there are no forward secrecy for this internal group communication; however, data exchanged internally between nodes constitutes the group history, and will be summarised for new nodes anyway, so this should not be a problem. In the following A, N and S denotes honest players, while A , N and S denotes arbitrary players, who may be dishonest (controlled by an attacking adversary). Due to our data-origin-authenticity assumption about the short-range link, the initial exchange of IDs, and the Diffie-Hellman symmetric key generation, an adversary must know the private key or choose the ID of each node, he is impersonating, to succeed. Notas de Implementação --------------------------------------- Our ECC implementation is shaped after the TinyECC [8] code and uses its large integer computation module (NNM.nc) unchanged. However, as communication and user interaction is needed in parallel with ECC calculations, we re-implemented the point calculations: an ECC calculation will be handed over to a task, performing one computation-step and re-posting itself until the computation is done. Avaliação -------------- We evaluated the time and energy consumption on the protocol as well as the different building blocks of the protocol using the “Energy Bucket” [15]. For comparison, a Panasonic CR1025 coin cell battery (1 cm in diameter) contains 324 J, while a tiny LR621 watch battery contains only 81 J, so 0.1 J can be quite a lot, if the procedure must be repeated often during the sensor’s lifetime. However, it would be fair to assume, that patients at hospitals—and at emergencies as well—would carry at least one big sensor or some kind of patient ID Under this assumption, the protocol requires less than 1% of the energy of a watch battery, which should be an acceptable price.

  Abstract                 = {Objectives: The aging of the population creates pressure on the healthcare systems in various ways. A massive increase of chronic disease conditions and age-related illness are predicted as the dominant forces driving the future health care. The objective of this paper is to present future research demands in pervasive healthcare with the goal to meet the healthcare challenges by paving the way for a pervasive, user-centered and preventive healthcare model. Methods: This paper presents recent methodological approaches and proposes future research topics in three areas: i) pervasive, continuous and reliable long-term monitoring systems; ii) prevention through pervasive technology as a key element to maintain lifelong wellness; and iii) design and evaluation methods for ubiquitous, patient-centric technologies. Results: Pervasive technology has been identified as a strong asset for achieving the vision of user-centered preventive healthcare. In order to make this vision a reality, new strategies for design, development and evaluation of technology have to find a common denominator and consequently interoperate. Moreover, the potential of pervasive healthcare technologies offers new opportunities beyond traditional disease treatment and may play a major role in prevention, e.g. motivate healthy behavior and disease prevention throughout all stages of life. In this sense, open challenges in future research have to be addressed such as the variability of health indicators between individuals and the manner in which relevant health indicators are provided to the users in order to maximize their motivation to mitigate or prevent unhealthy behaviors. Additionally, collecting evidence that pervasive technology improves health is seen as one of the toughest challenges. Promising approaches are recently introduced, such as "clinical proof-of-concept" and balanced observational studies. Conclusions: The paper concludes that pervasive healthcare will enable a paradigm shift from the established centralized healthcare model to a pervasive, user-centered and preventive overall lifestyle health management. In order to provide these new opportunities everywhere, anytime and to anyone, future research in the fields of pervasive sensing, pervasive prevention and evaluation of pervasive technology is inevitably needed.},

  Review                   = {Conceitos e requisitos para o desenvolvimento de um jogo voltador para idosos. Que promovam a execuçaõ de exercícios e dança. Hoje em dia o uso das tecnologias de realidade virtual contribuem para a terapia física no tratamento de Alzheimer, reabilitação e assim por diante. O propósito do projeto é desenvolver um sistema de jogo que contribua para o melhoramento cognitivo e as habilidades físicas dos desabilitados e idosos. Esse artigo descreve a realidade sócio-econômica e os requisitos técnicos para o desenvolvimento do jogo. Estudos sobre o Wii indicam que adolescentes gastam mais energia jogando esses jogos do que os sedentários, contudo não utilizam a energia gasta na prática de esportes em si. E que esse mesmo estudo conclui que praticar o Wii Sorts não é atividade física suficente para uma criança. A partir do Nintendo Wii e os sensores de movimento os jogos foram levados a um conceito de exergames, outros jogos começam a prover rreconhecimento cognitvo pelo esstímulo de atividades mentais. Foram realizados diversos estudos. Evidencias da sociedade de alzheimer sugerem que o pode haver reduçca do progresso da doenca, por intermédio de puzzles. Puzzles comecao a ser usados para atvidiades psicomotoras. para auxiliar na orientacao espacial, coordenacao visual e percepção visual. o projeto kinnect tem sensor de movimento e reconhecimento de voz. Expandir a demografia dos jogos para trabalhar c pessoas de diferentes faixas etárias, idosos, mulheres e assim por diante. Os novos sistemas de jogos têm expandido a capacidade cognitiva e física das pessoas. Entretanto, desenvolver novos jogos requer entender quais as habilidades cognitivas e físicas dos idosos, para que eles não sdesistam por conta da idade. Um grande número de idosos precisam de assistência por causa de dmência (20%) ou outras doencas 36%. Estudos indicam que pode haver uma diminuição da progressao da demneica se forem estimulados de forma fisica e mental. Ate mesmo jogar bingo pode ser estimulante para o idoso. Projeto Smart brain p alzheimer; escuta, cores, memósria insuficiente, movimento mais lento, ou risco de injúria ao fazer movimento brusco. é crucial que o jogador se sinta seguro ao jogar a partida. idosos têm dificuldade com novas tecnologias, são bastante relutantes à sua adoção. segundo o autor o kinect vêm revolucionar a usabilidade pois não é necessário algum periférico para a interação somente o corpo já é suficiente para a ação. De acordo com os estudos as mulheres gostam de socializar e os homens gostam de competir. É necessário que o jogo de dance ou esporte seja divertido para ser jogado novamente. Outro fator importante é q o jogo pode er uma ferramenta para aliviar a dor e os níveis de ansiedade. O movimento do corpo está numa frequencia de 30 hz em 48 pontos distintos,},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND} About 50\% of the patients with advanced Parkinson's disease ({PD)} suffer from freezing of gait ({FOG)}, which is a sudden and transient inability to walk. It often causes falls, interferes with daily activities and significantly impairs quality of life. Because gait deficits in {PD} patients are often resistant to pharmacologic treatment, effective non-pharmacologic treatments are of special interest. Objectives: The goal of our study is to evaluate the concept of a wearable device that can obtain real-time gait data, processes them and provides assistance based on pre-determined specifications. {METHODS} We developed a real-time wearable {FOG} detection system that automatically provides a cueing sound when {FOG} is detected and which stays until the subject resumes walking. We evaluated our wearable assistive technology in a study with 10 {PD} patients. Over eight hours of data was recorded and a questionnaire was filled out by each patient. {RESULTS} Two hundred and thirty-seven {FOG} events have been identified by professional physiotherapists in a post-hoc video analysis. The device detected the {FOG} events online with a sensitivity of 73.1\% and a specificity of 81.6\% on a 0.5 sec frame-based evaluation. {CONCLUSIONS} With this study we show that online assistive feedback for {PD} patients is possible. We present and discuss the patients' and physiotherapists' perspectives on wearability and performance of the wearable assistant as well as their gait performance when using the assistant and point out the next research steps. Our results demonstrate the benefit of such a context-aware system and motivate further studies.},

Volume II, this report, establishes the technical foundation for SEI work in CBSE. The paper asserts that the key technical challenge facing CBSE is to ensure that the properties of a system of components can be predicted from the properties of the components themselves. The key technical concepts of CBSE that are needed to support this vision are described: component, interface, contract, component model, component framework, composition, and certification.}},

Method— --------------- Twenty-seven articles were identified on 25 video games that promoted health-related behavior change through December 2006. Results— --------------- Most of the articles demonstrated positive health-related changes from playing the video games. Variability in what was reported about the games and measures employed precluded systematically relating characteristics of the games to outcomes. Many of these games merged the immersive, attention-maintaining properties of stories and fantasy, the engaging properties of interactivity, and behavior-change technology (e.g., tailored messages, goal setting). Stories in video games allow for modeling, vicarious identifying experiences, and learning a story’s “moral,” among other change possibilities. Conclusions— ---------------------- Research is needed on the optimal use of game-based stories, fantasy, interactivity,},

  Abstract                 = {Background— ---------------------- Video games provide extensive player involvement for large numbers of children and adults, and thereby provide a channel for delivering health behavior change experiences and messages in an engaging and entertaining format. Method— --------------- Twenty-seven articles were identified on 25 video games that promoted health-related behavior change through December 2006. Results— --------------- Most of the articles demonstrated positive health-related changes from playing the video games. Variability in what was reported about the games and measures employed precluded systematically relating characteristics of the games to outcomes. Many of these games merged the immersive, attention-maintaining properties of stories and fantasy, the engaging properties of interactivity, and behavior-change technology (e.g., tailored messages, goal setting). Stories in video games allow for modeling, vicarious identifying experiences, and learning a story’s “moral,” among other change possibilities. Conclusions— ---------------------- Research is needed on the optimal use of game-based stories, fantasy, interactivity,},

  Abstract                 = {As Redes de Sensores do Corpo Humano (RSCH) devem ser projetadas para operar de maneira autônoma. Por outro lado, devem oferecer mecanismos que remetam o controle aos profissionais da saúde. Um grande desafio no projeto de RSCH é oferecer de forma adequada (com transparência) acesso às configurações internas da rede e dos sensores, sem excluir a capacidade de operação autônoma desses sistemas. A tarefa de configuração de RSCH é usualmente realizada por desenvolvedores especializados, profissionais da Computação. Entretanto, para que essa tecnologia se torne clinicamente viável, é necessário que os próprios profissionais da área de saúde possam fazê-la. Esses profissionais são os responsáveis legais pelas decisões acerca do monitoramento dos pacientes, mesmo que essas decisões tenham sido geradas pelo próprio sistema. Esta tese discute os pressupostos supracitados e propõe um modelo capaz de acomodar essas necessidades. Dois conceitos relacionados à programação de RSCH são tratados neste trabalho: (i) programação (em tempo de compilação) e (ii) configuração (em tempo de execução). A programação refere-se à definição dos artefatos de software e algoritmos que são embutidos dentro dos sensores. Em RSCH a inclusão dessa funcionalidade requer uma interface para programação adequada aos profissionais da saúde e também de compiladores inteligentes. O compilador inteligente é um conceito novo apresentado nesta tese. Tem como objetivo aumentar a eficiência no uso dos sensores, considerando os requisitos da aplicação, os recursos do hardware e, principalmente, o conhecimento especialista para formulação das políticas que organizam o funcionamento do sistema. Como exemplo, a inclusão de mecanismos e políticas para tratar da economia de energia podem ser ajustadas por essas estruturas. A configuração refere-se à capacidade de ajuste do sistema sem a necessidade de reiniciar o hardware. Esse conceito possibilita maior interatividade entre o profissional da saúde e o sistema. Como requisito, os sensores precisam de mecanismos que possibilitem maior controle acerca das tarefas executadas. Uma possível solução é a utilização de estruturas de dados que possibilitem a aplicação do conceito de multitarefa nos sensores. Como contribuição maior é apresentada uma arquitetura de software denominada SOAB (Software Architecture for Body-worn Sensor Networks Project). A arquitetura SOAB é constituída por quatro camadas independentes: (i) uma interface para programação; (ii) um middleware para interconexão da RSCH com a Internet; (iii) um servidor para execução dos serviços solicitados pelos usuários e (iv) um sistema operacional com suporte para multitarefa, que será embutido nos nós sensores. Esse sistema operacional foi chamado MedOS. Tem como uma de suas funcionalidades aumentar o tempo de funcionamento dos nós sensores, promovendo a redução do consumo de energia elétrica por meio do escalonamento de tarefas com base em políticas adaptadas para aplicações biomédicas.},

  Review                   = {Esse trabalho corrobora com \cite{and09} quando fala que para as redes sensores serem viáveis clinicamente é necessário que os profissionais de saúde possam configurá-las. Redes Sensores -------------------------- As Redes de Sensores Sem Fios (RSSF), em inglês Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), exigem técnicas para tratamento de falhas e que promovam adaptação a condições ambientais diversas para que o tempo de funcionamento (sobrevida) desses sistemas seja o mais longo possível. Por exemplo, em muitos cenários a substituição ou a recarga das baterias é inviável, em termos de tempo (pode haver centenas de sensores) e acesso físico (sensores podem estar implantados no corpo humano). Além disso, é desejável que uma RSSF possa crescer em escala de forma incremental, isto é, pela adição de novos nós sensores e/ou novas funcionalidades (extensibility), ou pelo aumento do volume da informação manipulada (scalability). Assim, um possível aumento da concorrência por recursos do sistema não pode levar a perda da eficácia. De acordo com Lymberis (LYMBERIS & DITTMAR, 2007), a utilização desses sistemas possibilitará a redução de custos hospitalares, pela redução de internações e procedimentos ambulatoriais desnecessários. Também, a redução do erro médico porque a interação entre o paciente e o profissional da saúde estará disponível a qualquer hora e em qualquer lugar que se encontrem. ----------------ATENÇÃO COMO ESCREVER COMPUTAÇÃO VESTIDA -------------------------------------------------- No futuro, essa tecnologia poderá ser embutida na indumentária por meio de sistemas vestíveis (em inglês, wearable systems) e, até mesmo, distribuída dentro do próprio corpo sob forma de microrobôs e nanosensores. ========================================================== Por outro lado, é indispensável que as RSCH possam tratar falhas, tomar decisões e, até mesmo, atuar sobre o controle de uma aplicação, independentemente de comandos do usuário. Atualmente, o software utilizado em RSCH pode ser classificado de duas formas: 1. Por sistemas proprietários construídos em função do hardware e de uma única aplicação. 2. Baseado num modelo de programação genérico e de propósito geral (Tiny OS). Entretanto, aplicações desenvolvidas com base no TinyOS apresentam as seguintes limitações para emprego em RSCH: 1. A linguagem de programação NesC impõe sintaxe peculiar, baseada em conceitos emergentes da engenharia de software. 2. O modelo de multiprogramação oferecido pelo TinyOS é pouco interativo. Oferece muito pouco controle sobre as possíveis funcionalidades (tarefas) executadas pelos nós sensores, porque não há troca de contexto (Bardram cita que é preciso haver troca de contexto Activity Design). Assim, um grande desafio se apresenta aos projetistas de RSCH. Aumentar com transparência o acesso às configurações internas dos nós sensores e da rede, sem excluir a possibilidade de operação autônoma desses sistemas. Transparência refere-se a uma propriedade de sistema. Um sistema é mais transparente quando ao programador e/ou ao usuário são escondidos detalhes de implementação e do funcionamento desse sistema. --------------- A Transparencia é primordia para aceitação da RSCH. Detalhe em como o autor definiu o conceito de transparencia --------------- Objetivo do Trabalho ============= O objetivo principal deste trabalho é propor uma arquitetura de RSCH. Essa arquitetura comporta sistemas implementados por software e hardware. Esses sistemas oferecem suporte a um modelo de programação e configuração de RSCH, que é a principal inovação deste trabalho. A arquitetura de RSCH proposta neste trabalho foi validada pela implementação de protótipos (hardware e software) para provas de conceito. Cenários de Uso -------------------------- Num exemplo de aplicação desse sistema, se o módulo de monitoração contínua do ECG (eletrocardiograma) detectar a presença de uma arritmia cardíaca associada à queda da pressão arterial e o módulo de monitoração de sintomas capturar que o paciente está apresentando tontura e turvação visual (por exemplo, por meio de comandos de voz emitidos pelo próprio paciente), o sistema pode integrar essas informações e chegar à conclusão que o indivíduo está apresentando uma arritmia grave e que o estado do mesmo é grave TRabalho Proposto ----------------------------- A SOAB é constituída por quatro camadas: (i) aplicação, (ii) interconexão, (iii) serviços da RSCH e (iv) serviços do hardware. Neste trabalho foram considerados inicialmente dois perfis de usuário: o paciente e o profissional da saúde. Entretanto, o paciente é um agente passivo no que se refere à programação e a configuração dos sistemas de monitoramento, isto é, a ele não é atribuída nenhuma ação referente a essa atividade. Os médicos e demais profissionais da saúde representam o segundo perfil de usuário do sistema. Recebem e manipulam as informações obtidas pelo monitoramento e, principalmente, são os responsáveis por definir e modificar parâmetros referentes ao monitoramento de seus pacientes. --------------- Inovação do Trabalho --------------- O aspecto original deste trabalho envolve uma proposta de mudança do paradigma utilizado atualmente para programação e configuração das redes de sensores. Propõe que os próprios usuários dessa tecnologia possam definir as funcionalidades necessárias a cada momento e, ainda, intervir no sistema quando julgar pertinente. Isto, sem excluir a possibilidade desses sistemas se tornarem cada vez mais autônomos e eficientes. Assim, um modelo de programação e configuração de RSCH foi proposto. Esse modelo é suportado por um conjunto de abstrações agrupado em quatro níveis hierárquicos e organizados sob forma de uma arquitetura de software de sistema.},

As a result, the incidence of chronic disease is projected to increase, there are predicted shortages in health care workforce and budget restraints; implications for future health care provision are serious. The current model of health care is not equipped to deal with these changes. Connected health care, via the use of health informatics, disease management and home telehealth technologies, has been suggested as an approach to ease the projected strain on future health care. Evidence to date suggests a positive impact of the use of connected health care model; however, the majority of studies have overlooked the involvement of the community pharmacist. As the most common point of contact with primary health services for most of the population, the community pharmacist may be well placed to provide connected health care. The research to date is promising with improvements in outcomes for cardiovascular patients noted; however, further work is required to investigate the potential role the community pharmacist can play in the future of connected health care.},

We hypothesize that movement disorders in late-stage PD present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from accelerometer (ACC) and surface electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks. Although this paper focuses on a specific clinical application requiring advanced analysis techniques, the approach can be generalized to numerous applications in which data mining and other techniques can be used to analyze large data sets derived from wearable sensors.}},

However, the underlying testing and monitorization processes haven't experienced the innovation and advancement required to fulfill the needs that such diagnosis and treatment present. In this paper we propose a new testing device for Parkinson Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis patients. The device is designed to carry out two of the most used tests for these patients: the finger-tapping test and the hand-grip strength test. The designed system has been divided in three main blocks, which have been implemented and tested: a sensorizec glove, equipped with Force sensitive Resistors (FSR), a tiny hardware device which gathers the data and a PC application, which presents the results to the doctors.

This methodology was tested with cross validation through a sample of 20 Parkinson's disease patients. The assessment of methodology was carried out through some daily living activities which were detected using an activity recognition algorithm. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) severity classification of the algorithm coincides between 70 and 86% from that of a trained neurologist depending on the classifier used. These severities were calculated for 5 second segments of the signal with 50% of overlap. A bradykinesia profiler is also presented in this work. This profiler removes the overlap of the segments and calculates the confidence of the resulting events. It also calculates average severity, duration and symmetry values for those events. The profiler has been tested with a bogus dataset. Future work includes better training for the severity classifier with a larger sample and testing the profiler with real, longterm patient data in a projected pilot phase in three European hospitals.},

This profiler removes the overlap of the segments and calculates the confidence of the resulting events. It also calculates average severity, duration and symmetry values for those events. The profiler has been tested with a bogus dataset. The current work is related to a hardware and software platform that assesses the severity of the bradykinesia symptom in motor disease patients and condenses the information in a way that is easily analyzable and useful to the physician. The dataset used in this study includes trials with twenty Parkinsonian patients, ten in the Navarra and ten in Ioannina, resulting in twenty full cross validations used to train the algorithm and test the method (see TABLE I and TABLE II). . Sensors and materia The data collection was performed with a network of wireless 3-axis accelerometers located on the limbs, trunk and belt of the patient. To classify the epochs, 6 classifiers were used: Knnc K-nearest neighbor classifier, ParzencParzen classifier, ParzendcParzen density based classifier, Treec Construct binary decision tree, Bpxnc Train neural network classifiers by Back-propagation and SVC support vector classifier. All the classification techniques used are characterized by high performances when using huge amount of data. However, as each classifier has different computational charge, all the techniques were tested to find the optimum solution in terms of accuracy and calculation time. The implemented method gives, as output, the severity level of Bradykinesia symptom, according to the UDPRS, where 0 describes the absence of the symptom and 4 describes the highest possible value The criterion followed to distinguish a peak from a short event is given by the clinician recommendations. For the case of bradykinesia, the clinically significant time length is seconds. That means sections in the signal of less than 15 seconds will be tagged as noise. Furthermore, the algorithm returns a list of the events detected, providing start and end times, severity and confidence. Furthermore, the bradykinesia model will provide another parameter widely used in the assessment of the bradykinesia such as the asymmetry, that means the difference of the UPDRS value between the right and left side of the body and the top and bottom limbs. IV. DISCUSSION To the best of our knowledge, there are no other reports of quantifying bradykinesia severity without requiring standard motor tests. The novel method presented above, using unconstructed, daily life activities, may be causing the symptom severity accuracies within the range of 70%-86%. Future work in this part includes the collection of a larger data sample and the implementation of a meta-analysis to improve accuracy. As for the bradykinesia profiling component of the system, the structure of the method so far is meaningful in that it allows physicians to monitor and detect changes in the symptomatic behavior as quickly as the changes appear. A remotely installed system, at the patient’s home, with such capabilities could eventually redefine the paradigm of taking care of motor neurodegenerative disease patients, providing far more and richer information to be used by doctors at the time of making decisions or designing treatments.},

  Abstract                 = {The current work describes a methodology to automatically detect the severity of bradykinesia in motor disease patients using wireless, wearable accelerometers. This methodology was tested with cross validation through a sample of 20 Parkinson's disease patients. The assessment of methodology was carried out through some daily living activities which were detected using an activity recognition algorithm. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) severity classification of the algorithm coincides between 70 and 86% from that of a trained neurologist depending on the classifier used. These severities were calculated for 5 second segments of the signal with 50% of overlap. A bradykinesia profiler is also presented in this work. This profiler removes the overlap of the segments and calculates the confidence of the resulting events. It also calculates average severity, duration and symmetry values for those events. The profiler has been tested with a bogus dataset. Future work includes better training for the severity classifier with a larger sample and testing the profiler with real, longterm patient data in a projected pilot phase in three European hospitals.},

The home is, in fact, becoming a locus for health care innovation that may in the future compete with the hospital.

  Review                   = {prCitações interessantes : Muitos indivíduos ingerem um diferente número de medicações por dia e sentem dificuldade em gerenciar qual a pílula correta para cada evento (Lundell et al. 2006). One such tool is an electronic caddy that centralizes medications in an automatic dispensing machine with audio prompts for when to take various pills. With a stand-alone system, however, individuals may miss or ignore the caddy prompts and the caddy may not offer assistance if someone deviates from the normal medication routine. --- Instead, a remotely connected medication system could alert caregivers of improper medication use in real time, offering the opportunity to intervene before any serious health damage is done. --- Social connectedness In studies of seniors with dementia who are living at home, one area in which those seniors and caregivers need assistance is in maintaining social connectedness with their friends and relatives. Maintaining quality social health can lead to improvement in overall health and help to maintain a greater quality of life (Haslam et al. 2008). Providing feedback on social health can make seniors and caregivers more proactive in initiating social contact. ------ Data transmission and analysis There are two primary means of applying the above described technologies to home health care: 1) for purposes of event-based transmission and analysis 2) continuous transmission and analysis, which are described below. Event Based: An event-based transmission and analysis system is one that records the occurrence of particular, discrete events, throughout the designated care period. Continuous For some applications, the use of discrete measurements or stationary measuring devices may not be appropriate, or sufficient. Thus, another option for remote home health care technologies lies in the field of continuous transmission and analysis those devices that record information constantly while in use. ----------- Privacy and remote home health care technologies ================================ Therefore, it is important to consider the privacy implications of these technologies, and to design privacy into their development and implementation Se a privacidade for levada em consideração durante o processo de desenvolvimento, haverá um grande potencial que as tecnologias desenvolvidas, tenham a maior possibilidade de gerenciar a privacidade. Information privacy defined ------------------------------------------ Information privacy is an individual’s ability to exercise control over the collection, use, disclosure and retention of his or her personal information, including personal health information. Personal information (also known as personally identifiable information or “PII”) is any information, recorded or otherwise, relating to an identifiable individual. When considering information and communication technologies, it is important to recognize that privacy subsumes a set of protections that extend far greater than security. We call this “SmartPrivacy.”4 Privacy by Design --------------------------- Privacy by Design (PbD) is a concept developed by Dr. Ann Cavoukian, in the midnineties. In brief, PbD is a concept that involves embedding privacy into the design specifications of technologies. This process begins by building the principles of Fair Information Practices (FIPs) into the design, operation and management of information processing technologies and systems, and then elaborates them to the gold standard of becoming the default. In total, the three areas of application are: (1) information technology; (2) accountable business practices; and (3) physical design and networked infrastructure. Perhaps the best known code of fair information practices was developed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), called “Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data”. These guidelines are as follows: 1) Collection Limitation Principle—There should be limits to the collection of personal data and any such data should be obtained by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge and consent of the data subject. 2) Data Quality Principle—Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which they are to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete and kept up-to-date. 3) Purpose Specification Principle—The purposes for which personal data are collected should be specified not later ----------- Atenção esse princípio impacta diretamente 4) Use Limitation Principle—Personal data should not be disclosed, made available or otherwise used for purposes other than those specified inaccordance with principle 3, above, except: a) with the consent of the data subject, or b) by the authority of law. ----------- 5) Security Safeguards Principle—Personal data should be protected by reasonable security safeguards against such risks as loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure of data. 6) Openness Principle—There should be a general policy of openness about developments, practices and policies with respect to personal data. Means should be readily available of establishing the existence and nature of personal data, and the main purposes of their use, as well as the identity and usual residence of the data controller. 7) Individual Participation Principle—An individual should have the right: a. To obtain from a data controller, or otherwise, confirmation b. To have communicated to him or her, data relating to him or her i. Within a reasonable time; at a charge, if any, that is not excessive; in a reasonable manner; and in a form that is readily intelligible to him or her; c. To be given reasons if a request made under subparagraphs (a) and (b) is denied, and to be able to challenge such denial; and d. To challenge data relating to him/her and, if the challenge is successful to have the data erased, rectified, completed or amended. 8) Accountability Principle—A data controller should be accountable for complying with measures which give effect to the principles stated above. ===================== Segundo o autor os princípios do design baseado em privacidade deve ser aplicado a qualquer sistema de informação pessoal, e com maior rigor para sistemas de informações médicas. O autor lista 7 princiípios principais para sistemas de monitoramento de pacientes: 1. Proactive not reactive; Preventative not remedial - It anticipates and prevents privacy-invasive events, before they happen. This proactive approach is fundamental in an environment where the technology is specifically focused on proactively preventing negative health consequences. 2. Privacy as the default - seeks to deliver the maximum degree of privacy by ensuring that personal data are automatically protected in any given IT system or business practice 3. Privacy embedded into design- Privacy must be embedded into the design and architecture of IT systems and business practices. It is not bolted on as an add-on, after the fact. The result is that privacy becomes an essential component of the core functionality being delivered. 4. Functionality—Positive-sum, not zero-sum - Privacy by Design seeks to accommodate all legitimate interests and objectives in a positive-sum “win-win” manner, not through a dated, zero-sum approach, where unnecessary trade-offs are made. Privacy by Design avoids the pretence of false dichotomies, such as privacy vs. security, or privacy vs. availability, demonstrating that it is possible to have it all. --- GRande IMPACTO E PRINCIPAL PROBLEMA In the health technology industry, this positive-sum paradigm is increasingly critical. No patient should be forced to encounter a trade-off between functionality and information security or privacy. The key for these individuals, and these technologies, is to be patient-outcome focussed; however, there is a moral imperative not to force a trade-off between privacy and good health in order to achieve these objectives. In particular, ensuring that the positive-sum paradigm is followed will involve furthering the Use Limitation principle. Individuals should be empowered with choices about the data pertaining to themselves—the purposes for which the data is accessed, and by whom it can be accessed. --- 5. End-to-end lifecycle protection Privacy by Design, having been embedded into the system prior to the first element of information being collected, extends throughout the entire lifecycle of the data involved, from start to finish. This ensures that at the end of the process, all data are securely destroyed, in a timely fashion. 6. Visibility and transparency Privacy by Design seeks to assure all stakeholders that whatever the business practice or technology involved, it is in fact, operating according to the stated promises and objectives, subject to independent verification. A key point to the transparency within these systems is ensuring that the patient in question knows, or at least can know, what data is being collected, how that data is being used, and who can access it. 7. Respect for users’ privacy Above all, Privacy by Design requires architects and operators to keep the interests of the individual uppermost by offering such measures as strong privacy defaults, appropriate notice, and empowering user-friendly options. ========================= Practical application of Privacy by Design: GE’s QuietCare and Intel’s Health Guide O autor falou da aplicação GE's Quiet Care The QuietCare system was designed to provide assisted living facilities with notification of change in established behaviour patterns and notifications that a particular event has occurred. ================== Conclusões ------------------ Home health care is not reserved for the elderly. This technology may also be applied to any individual with a chronic condition that requires frequent, or constant, care. However, given the demographics of the aging populations in Canada, the United States and all around the world, along with estimates that only 15% of people over 80 do not have a chronic condition (Intel Health 2007), or that 85% of those over 80 do have a chronic condition, it becomes clear that remote home health care technologies are poised to become a vital part of the overall health care provision environment. The economic burden to health care systems in these scenarios is also very high. Using the principles of Privacy by Design, the interests of both patient and caregiver may be met, and the provision of home health care may be delivered in a highly effective, privacy-protective manner. Companies such as Intel and GE Healthcare are proving that a positive-sum paradigm is not only desirable—it is indeed achievable—positive-sum, all the way. In home health care, it may be the only way.},

  Review                   = {videogame, active gaming ou exergame (EXG) são termos usados para definir um novo fenômeno de videogame, no qual a interface de esforço permite uma nova experiência. principalmente nas Ciências da Saúde [Vaghetti & Botelho, 2010], em áreas como Medicina, Fisioterapia e, particularmente, a Educação Física (EF) que, devido à possibilidade de incorporá-los no currículo, tem atraído a atenção dos educadores em escolas e universidades. Sinclair et al. [2007]: a) sua eficácia em termos de esforço físico, a intensidade do exercício físico e as habilidades motoras exigidas pelo jogo e b) a atratividade como uma atividade divertida e cativante, que irá atrair o jogador e fazê-lo permanecer imerso na narrativa do jogo. A ideia de atratividade em um jogo é dependente da forma como a habilidade do jogador é combinada com os desafios e com a narrativa do jogo e também suportada pela teoria do fluxo desenvolvida por Csikszentmihalyi, em 1975, chamada de psicologia da ótima experiência. Segundo esse autor, durante a experiência de fluxo, como um estado mental, perdemos a noção do tempo e as preocupações, de fato, nosso nível de foco maximiza o nosso desempenho e sensação de prazer da atividade, o fluxo é também chamado de experiência ideal, ou estar na "zona de fluxo". Com base nos conceitos apontados, as propostas para o uso de EXG em rede, na Educação Física a distância e e-learning, devem envolver uma adequação educacional, que pode ser realizada através do uso de estratégias instrucionais [Dick et al., 2001]. EXG (consoles e jogos) em rede e sua utilidade para a Educação Física, com vistas a: a) Investigar as capacidades físicas exigidas nos jogos; b) Classificar os jogos de acordo com o CEF e explorar a possibilidade de utilização na educação a distância e e-learning; c) Explorar a Teoria do Fluxo como parâmetro para uma experiência positiva em ambiente de aprendizagem virtual on-line. Trout e Zamora [2005] relataram que algumas escolas no estado da Califórnia, EUA, incluíram em seus programas de EF o game Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), como integrante do currículo. Outro estudo também foi realizado em vinte escolas da Virgínia Ocidental (EUA), acerca do uso de DDR e sua relação com a saúde; resultados mostraram que alguns alunos perderam gordura corporal após usarem o jogo na escola [Liberman, 2006]. O console EXG difere dos videogames sedentários [Bidiss & Irwin, 2010], devido ao esforço físico e às capacidades físicas exigidas pelo jogo. Na verdade, todos os videogames demandam atividade cognitiva e tempo de reação auditivo e visual, além da coordenação dos dedos para a manipulação do joystick durante o jogo. No entanto, o console EXG exige outras capacidades físicas, como a resistência, a coordenação de membros superiores e inferiores, a velocidade, a força, o equilíbrio e a flexibilidade para suportar a jogabilidade e o enredo dos games. A habilidade motora para jogar EXG envolve a utilização de um conjunto de capacidades físicas; assim, cada game exige níveis diferenciados de capacidades. Optou-se, nesta pesquisa, por apresentar as capacidades físicas mais evidentes em cada jogo investigado. Outro aspecto interessante que potencializa o gasto calórico é o aumento da V dos braços para executar os golpes de boxe, associado a um tempo prolongado de exercício, já que vencer o jogo implica lutar contra novo adversário ou inimigo. Outros jogos de luta com jogabilidade em rede são Kinect Sports (boxing), Deca Sports Freedom (boxing) e Deca Sports 3 (fencing); todos eles exigem um trabalho de R. Assim como os games de dança, os de luta são os games com maior gasto calórico e são citados como ferramentas eficazes na promoção da saúde e atividade física [Graves et al., 2007; Lanningham-Foster et al., 2009]. distância e e-learning Huizinga [2005] relata que o jogo habita a vida de diferentes instituições educativas formais e informais e ainda faz parte da sociabilidade humana de maneira lúdica, alegre e prazerosa. Os EXG investigados nesta pesquisa permitem que os CEF possam ser transportados para o ciberespaço, possibilitando que conteúdos teórico-práticos da EF sejam trabalhados a distância. A constatação admite que, assim como no Second Life, indivíduos separados geograficamente possam se encontrar para uma reunião em um ambiente virtual; jogadores também podem se encontrar em um ambiente virtual para um jogo de tênis em dupla, sendo um deles o professor. Silveira e Torres [2007] investigaram os jogos eletrônicos na Educação Física escolar e os resultados da pesquisa indicam a necessidade de as escolas refletirem sobre a seleção dos jogos eletrônicos como conteúdo, oferecendo possibilidades de educar os jovens para a cultura eletrônica que, a exemplo de outras formas culturais, interferem na capacidade de os sujeitos perceberem a realidade.[ em disciplinas como Fisiologia do Exercício e Bioquímica. Games como arco e flecha e a maioria dos esportes de tiro são exemplos envolvendo a complexidade do controle motor e da performance na disciplina de Aprendizagem Motora, além do Guitar Hero, que permite o aprendizado de habilidades motoras finas. O Wii Fit possui games que permitem realizar movimentos de ioga em uma plataforma que mensura, além da massa corporal, o centro de pressão da força-peso na área da base de sustentação, sendo o equilíbrio variável fundamental no entendimento do movimento humano em disciplinas como Biomecânica. O game é uma experiência autotélica por natureza, o jogador joga por puro prazer, não espera nada em troca, desta forma busca-se discutir as ferramentas e meios com potencial para produzir no aluno essa motivação. Apesar da importância do Fluxo para o engajamento do aluno no aprendizado e do jogador no game, apenas uma pesquisa, no grupo Design de EXG, apresentou um protótipo no qual os designers utilizaram o fluxo como parâmetro de engajamento e diversão.},

  Review                   = {Sensors and In-Home Collection of Health Data: A Privacy by Design Approach --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As tags de RFID são bastante utilizadas par começar a implementar sensores de segurança. Um dos problemas de RFID é que possui dados estáticos em detrimento a outras mídias Importante: Os sensores podem ser definidos de dois tipos: - Behavioural sensors: que através da detecção de movimento consegue identificar um padrão de ação - Charecteristic sensors- que medem os atributos fisiológicos do indivíduo: temperatura, pressão sangüínea, nível de stress, glicose. Esses sensores armazenam ou reagem ao dado adquirido. Existem benefícios significantes advindos das tecnologias de home health care (essas tecnolgoias provêem o suporte sem a presença de um clínico). Os custos com atendimento de saúde são reduzidos tanto para os planos de saúdeo quanto para o indivíduo. Isto está associado ao tempo disponível, necessidade de ir a uma clínica para atendimento, além de ser um tratamento preventivo através da detecção das adversidades clínicas [1, 2]. Privacy By Design ----------------- Para Kotz a aplicação de deve ter seu design baseado na privacidade. Para tanto ele identifica três funcionalidades que devem ser respeitadas para o atendimento a saúde: 1. Mais dados clínicos devem ser coletadas sobre os pacientes, os sensores devem permitir o monitoramento contínuo. 2. Dados sobre as situações clínicas do paciente, assim com informações fisiológicas a respeito do estilo de vida. 3. Um conjunto de aplicações poderiam estar disponíveis para avaliar o conjunto de dados adquirido pelos sensores. A habilidade de manter a privacidade e segurança é um fator determinante para o sucesso dos sistemas remotos de assitência; Ler: [1] Pekka Raatikainen, M.J. et al.

  Abstract                 = {Recognition of specific Parkinsonian gait patterns is helpful in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there are few computer-aided methods to identify the specific gait patterns of PD. We propose a vision-based diagnostic system to aid in recognition of the gait patterns of Parkinson's disease. The proposed system utilizes an algorithm combining principal component analysis (PCA) with linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This scheme not only addresses the high data dimensionality problem during image processing but also distinguishes different gait categories simultaneously. The feasibility of the proposed system for the recognition of PD gait was tested by using gait videos of PD and normal subjects. The efficiency of feature extraction using PCA and LDA coefficients are also compared. Experimental results showed that LDA had a recognition rate for Parkinsonian gait of 95.49%, which is higher than the conventional PCA feature extraction method. The proposed system is a promising aid in identifying the gait of Parkinson's disease patients and can discriminate the gait patterns of PD patients and normal people with a very high classification rate.},

  Review                   = {A maioria dos métodos utilizados para avaliar a DP, necessitam do expertise humano, como por exemplo no uso da UPDRS. A análise das características de movimento, documentada por Knutsson (1972), demonstra que os pacientes da DP, exibem uma larga variabilidade de movimento compara as pessoas normais. Esles caminham mais devagar a passos mais curtos e a amplitude de movimento das articulações é diminuída. Isso especifica um padrão de movimento, largamente aceito como característica proeminente da doença. (McDowell, 1971). Entretando, a postura do movimento pode variar de pessoa para pessoa, a avaliação de movimento do parkisoniando tende a ser subjetiva e depende fortemente do expertis de julgamento do médico (Blin, Ferrandez, & Serratrice, 1990; Lubik et al., 2006; Melnick, Radtka, & Piper, 2002; Shan et al., 2001; Salarian et al., 2004; Sofuwa et al., 2005; Stern et al., 1983; Vokaer, Azar, & Beyl, 2003). As a result, engineering-oriented machine learning-based methods have attracted more and more attention in this field (Engin et al., 2007; Fahrenberg et al., 1997; Makikawa & Iizumi, 1995; Sekine et al., 2002; Veltink et al., 1996). Many previous studies have used dc and ac accelerometers to assess gait patterns. They classified the accelerometer signals into different typesof walking and correlated them with energy consumption. Nevertheless, those methods often used a number of sensors, causing patient discomfort.

  Abstract                 = {As redes de sensores sem fio, RSSFs, já são uma realidade hoje em dia e representam uma ferramenta fundamental para monitorar sinais vitais de pacientes. Muitas aplicações médicas beneficiam-se de padrões baseados em tecnologias sem fio como o IEEE 802.15.4. Este trabalho consiste em produzir, através de simulações com o Network Simulator, NS, os documentos essenciais a um estudo para uma aplicação médica que envolve redes de sensores sem fio. Para isso são realizadas simulações em dois diferentes cenários, utilizando métricas como vazão e taxa de entrega, com objetivo de definir a melhor configuração de uma rede de sensores médicos sem fio, que garanta a qualidade de serviço, QoS, especificada para esse problema.},

  Review                   = {O objetivo deste trabalho é simular, através do Network Simulator: - duas diferentes topologias de rede - produzir os documentos essenciais a um estudo de viabilidade para uma aplicação médica Este trabalho é embasado em : - conceitos relacionados as tecnologias sem fio - uso em rede de sensores sem fio, - padrão IEEE 802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4. 2003], - além de algumas noções básicas sobre rede de sensores sem fio aplicadas na assistência á pacientes [European Commission 2004] [Kim 2007]. [ATENÇÃO] Dentre os padrões de redes sem fio presentes no mercado destacam-se o ZigBee, Bluetooth, e Wi- Fi. Nas aplicações de monitoramento com sensores sem fio, destas tecnologias o Wi-Fi apresenta um consumo de energia maior. Fatores como consumo de energia, baixa latência e custo fazem do padrão ZigBee o mais adequado. O Bluetooth apesar de apresentar um baixo custo, alta latência e consumo ainda elevado, não o faz adequado a este tipo de aplicação [Santos 2007] O trabalho é baseado em aplicações médicas que não necessitam de uma elevada taxa de dados. O estudo se baseia em métricas como vazão e taxa de entrega de dados com o objetivo de validar a especificação de uma rede de sensores médicos que garanta qualidade de serviço, QoS [European Commission 2004]. Redes Sensores Biomédicos -------------------------------------------- Uma rede de sensores médicos é formada por pequenos nós sensores de baixa potência, multifuncionais, que são equipados por sensores biomédicos e possuem uma unidade de processamento [Ruzzelli 2007]. Sensores biomédicos são usados para identificar mudanças biológicas e monitorar parâmetros biológicos em tecidos e órgãos. Estes dispositivos monitoraram parâmetros como a pressão sanguínea, temperatura, entre outros. A implementação de uma rede de sensores biomédicos sem fio para atuar em uma aplicação de monitoramento de pacientes pode requerer um certo desempenho em relação ás métricas: banda de rede, vazão, qualidade do sinal, tempo de resposta, latência, taxa de entrega de pacotes e variação do atraso entre pacotes [Ruzzelli 2007]. Simulação ---------------- O objetivo da simulação neste cenário com 2 nós foi o de se verificar a taxa de entrega e a taxa de dados para o dado cenário que será utilizado na especificação da rede. Cenário 2 Tomando por base o resultado das simulações do cenário 1, o passo seguinte foi criar um outro cenário em topologia estrela com os nós fontes enviando pacotes diretamente para o coordenador da sub-rede, o qual dependendo dos resultados desta simulação será também o nó roteador conectado diretamente ao coordenador da rede de sensores médicos. Comentários -------------------- A rede será formada por uma segunda topologia no formato estrela, nesta segunda parte para a especificação da rede de sensores são usados cenários na topologia mencionada que se diferenciam pela quantidade de nós fontes. De acordo com os resultados dos cenários simulados, poderemos montar a rede de sensores, com um computador central, equipado com um módulo que dará suporte ao padrão ZigBee baseado na definição 802.15.4 do IEEE, que receberá através do coordenador da sub-rede estrela os dados transmitidos de 4 nós fontes ECG formadores desta sub-rede que estarão no corpo do paciente para a coleta dos dados como mostrado na Figura 3.4. Conclusões ------------------ O trabalho é focado no estudo de uma aplicação médica que garanta a qualidade de serviço, através do uso das métricas como vazão de dados e taxa de entrega do padrão IEEE 802.15.4. Foram simulados dois cenários, o primeiro ponto-a-ponto e de acordo com seus resultados foi criado o segundo cenário do tipo estrela; a integração destes foi utilizada para a especificação da rede de sensores médicos sem fio com o mínimo de confiabilidade possível com base em seus resultados. Para se estimar uma taxa de envio de dados para a determinada aplicação a taxa de entrega considerada deverá estar acima de 90%, para prover certa confiabilidade no desempenho. Este estudo pode servir de consulta para elaboração de trabalhos futuros. PEGAR ---------- [European Commission 2004] O objetivo destas simulações é produzir documentos necessários a um estudo que viabilize a especificação para uma aplicação médica que garanta qualidade de serviço. Com o uso das métricas vazão de dados e taxa de entrega do IEEE 802.15.4 em alguns cenários adequados à aplicação de monitoramento de sinais fisiológicos vitais de pacientes.},

  Review                   = {Esse artigo faz uma análise comparativa das técnicas de classificação aplicadas em estudos recentes: Redes Neurais, DMNEural, Regressão e Árvore de Decisão respectivamente. Vários métodos foram aplicados para avaliar esses scores. In literature, it is claimed that approximately 90% of people with Parkinson’s disease exhibit some form of vocal impairment (Ho, Iansek, Marigliani, Bradshaw, & Gates, 1998; Little et al., 2008). The people with Parkinson’s typically display a constellation of vocal symptom that includes impairment in the normal production of vocal sounds, which is dysphonia. The voice will sound hoarse, strained or effortful. The voice may be difficult to understand because their voice sounds very quiet or is so distinctive that it distracts from the content of what the person is saying. In these studies, the speech sounds produced during standard speech tests are recorded using a microphone, and the recorded speech signals are subsequently analyzed using measurement methods (implemented in software algorithms) designed to detect certain properties of these signals. Methods from statistical learning theory are proposed such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machines (SVM) (Hastie et al., 2001). dataset was created by Max Little of the University of Oxford, in collaboration with the National Centre for Voice and Speech, Denver, Colorado, who recorded the speech signals. The original study published the feature extraction methods for general voice disorders. This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Each column in the table is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds one of 195 voice recording from these individuals (‘‘name” column). The main aim of the data is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to ‘‘status” column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD. The data is in ASCII CSV format. The rows of the CSV file contain an instance corresponding to one voice recording. There are around six recordings per patient; the name of the patient is identified in the first column. DMNeural node is to perform both principal component analysis and DMneural network training. Principal component modelling is based on constructing an independent linear of input variables in which the coefficients capture the maximum amount of variability in the data. DMneural network training is an additive nonlinear model that uses a set of principal components that are placed into separate buckets to predict either a binary-valued or interval valued target variable. Decision tree node provides a completely different approach to classification. A decision tree develops a series of if-then rules. Each rule assigns an observation to one segment of the tree, at which point another if-then rule is applied. The initial segment, containing the entire data set, is the root node for the decision tree. Conclusão: Moreover a comparative study was aimed indeed. The neural network classifier yielded the best score. The experimental results gained 92.9% classification accuracy for neural networks. Another comparative study was also conducted},

  Abstract                 = {Healthcare systems are being extended to monitor patients with body sensors wirelessly linked to a mobile phone that interacts with remote healthcare services and staff. As such systems become more widespread, with multiple healthcare providers and security domains, the establishment of trust between users, providers and medical staff will become important. In this paper we implement the ETTG privacy-preserving trust negotiation protocol and show how it can be used to automatically establish mutual trust between interacting parties in compliance with access-control and disclosure policies. The protocol is implemented in Java and can be run on J2ME platforms. The trust negotiation steps are logged and the resulting trust graphs can be visualised to show how policy compliance was achieved. We also develop a new easier-to-understand syntax for ETTG and use it to define access-control and disclosure policies for a small pervasive healthcare scenario.},

  Review                   = {Na Doença de Parkinson, há perda dos neurônios que produzem o neurotransmissor dopamina na substância negra – estrutura do cérebro que participa do controle e da coordenação dos movimentos, assim como da manutenção do tônus muscular e da postura Há pesquisas que procuram encontrar medicamentos “neuroproteores”, cujo intuito é proteger o cérebro do desenvolvimento da doença e impedir a sua instalação. O neurologista deverá ser consultado para que se possa definir se há necessidade de remédios e quais deverão ser empregados. A doença de Parkinson é uma condição crônica. A evolução dos sintomas é usualmente lenta, mas é variável em cada caso. A doença de Parkinson é a forma mais freqüente de parkinsonismo. Doença de Parkinson e parkinsonismo não são sinônimos. Parkinsonismo é um termo genérico que designa uma série de doenças com causas diferentes e que têm em comum a presença de sintomas parkinsonianos (ou seja, aqueles sintomas encontrados na doença de Parkinson). A doença de Parkinson é uma das muitas formas de parkinsonismo e também a mais freqüente. Corresponde a cerca de 75% de todas as formas de parkinsonismo. Como não se conhece a causa da doença de Parkinson, ela é também chamada de parkinsonismo primário. O mal de Parkinson é também chamado de parkinsonismo primário porque é uma doença para a qual nenhuma causa conhecida foi identificada. Por outro lado, se diz que um parkinsonismo é secundário naqueles casos em que uma causa pode ser identificada. Cerca de 75% de todas as formas de parkinsonismo correspondem à forma primária. Prevenção ---------------- Não existe a prevenção para a Doença de Parkinson, existe a perspectiva de que em breve possa identificar os indivíduos com maiores chances de desenvolver a doença, e assim no futuro poderá desenvolver drogas que impedissem, ou pelo menos atrasassem, o aparecimento dos sintomas. Tratamento da Doença de Parkinson ---------------------------------------------------------- O tratamento é feito com medicações que controlam os sintomas. O médico dispõe hoje de um arsenal que é suficiente para controlar o problema da grande maioria dos pacientes. Esses medicamentos são freqüentemente usados em combinação e muitos pacientes usam simultaneamente de duas a quatro medicações diferentes. Para que isso dê certo é preciso que o médico conheça bem os problemas da doença e saiba utilizar as drogas adequadamente SINTOMAS INICIAIS ---------------------------- Os primeiros sintomas da doença de Parkinson têm início de modo quase imperceptível o que faz com que o próprio paciente não consiga identificar o início preciso das primeiras manifestações. Muitas vezes, amigos ou familiares são os primeiros a notar as primeiras mudanças. OS PRIMEIROS SINAIS PODEM SER UM OU MAIS DOS SEGUINTES: 1- Sensação de cansaço ou mal-estar no fim do dia 2- Caligrafia menos legível ou com tamanho diminuído 3- Fala monótona e menos articulada 4- Depressão ou isolamento sem motivo aparente 5- Lapsos de memória, dificuldade de concentração e irritabilidade 6- Dores musculares, principalmente na região lombar. 7- Um dos braços ou uma perna movimenta-se menos do que a do outro lado 8- Expressão facial perde a espontaneidade 9- Diminuição da freqüência dos piscamentos 10- Movimentos tornam-se mais vagarosos, a pessoa permanece por mais tempo em uma mesma posição},

In this study, we combine kinematic models designed for control of robotic arms with the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to continuously estimate the angles of human shoulder and elbow using two wearable sensors.

  Abstract                 = {{ There has been increased research interest in the use of active video games (in which players physically interact with images onscreen) as a means to promote physical activity in children. The aim of this review was to assess active video games as a means of increasing energy expenditure and physical activity behavior in children. Studies were obtained from computerized searches of multiple electronic bibliographic databases. The last search was conducted in December 2008. Eleven studies focused on the quantification of the energy cost associated with playing active video games, and eight studies focused on the utility of active video games as an intervention to increase physical activity in children. Compared with traditional nonactive video games, active video games elicited greater energy expenditure, which was similar in intensity to mild to moderate intensity physical activity. The intervention studies indicate that active video games may have the potential to increase free-living physical activity and improve body composition in children; however, methodological limitations prevent definitive conclusions. Future research should focus on larger, methodologically sound intervention trials to provide definitive answers as to whether this technology is effective in promoting long-term physical activity in children. }},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND: The ability to maintain a steady gait rhythm is impaired in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). This aspect of locomotor dyscontrol, which likely reflects impaired automaticity in PD, can be quantified by measuring the stride-to-stride variability of gait timing. Previous work has shown an increase in both the variability of the stride time and swing time in PD, but the origins of these changes are not fully understood. Patients with PD also generally walk with a reduced gait speed, a potential confounder of the observed changes in variability. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between walking speed and gait variability. METHODS: Stride time variability and swing time variability were measured in 36 patients with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage 2-2.5) and 30 healthy controls who walked on a treadmill at four different speeds: 1) Comfortable walking speed (CWS), 2) 80\% of CWS 3) 90\% of CWS, and 4) 110\% of CWS. In addition, we studied the effects of walking slowly on level ground, both with and without a walker. RESULTS: Consistent with previous findings, increased variability of stride time and swing time was observed in the patients with PD in CWS, compared to controls. In both groups, there was a small but significant association between treadmill gait speed and stride time variability such that higher speeds were associated with lower (better) values of stride time variability (p = 0.0002). In contrast, swing time variability did not change in response to changes in gait speed. Similar results were observed with walking on level ground. CONCLUSION: The present results demonstrate that swing time variability is independent of gait speed, at least over the range studied, and therefore, that it may be used as a speed-independent marker of rhythmicity and gait steadiness. Since walking speed did not affect stride time variability and swing time variability in the same way, it appears that these two aspects of gait rhythmicity are not entirely controlled by the same mechanisms. The present findings also suggest that the increased gait variability in PD is disease-related, and not simply a consequence of bradykinesia.}},

  Review                   = {Abstract—Nonobtrusive options for monitoring the wrist and hand movement are needed for stroke rehabilitation and other applications. We describe an approach to estimate the wrist and finger joint angles using a radial basis function network that maps differential magnetometer readings to joint angles. Manumeter estimates scaled proportionally to the intensity of hand activity. Estimates of angular excursion made with the manumeter were 92.5% ± 28.4 (SD), 98.3% ± 23.3, and 94.7% ± 19.3 of the goniometric exoskeleton across the three testing days, respectively. Currently, questionnaires such as the Motor Activity Log (MAL) are used to assess daily use of the upper and lower extremity after neurologic injuries such as stroke. The MAL is an interview that asks subjects to rate on an ordinal scale how much and how well they use their impaired arms to accomplish activities of daily living [5]. This test relies on subjective interpretation that can lead to inconsistent assessment results [6]–[8]. To address these limitations, we developed a nonobtrusive device to monitor daily use of the hand and wrist in an uncontrolled environment. Here, we use the new term “manumeter” to refer to a device used to measure the (angular) distance traveled by joints of the hand (Latin: “manus”), mimicing the existing term “pedometer,” which refers to a device that measures the distance travelled by foot (Latin: “pedites”). The manumeter described here uses a magnetic sensing system that is packaged in a socially acceptable ring and watch-like unit (see Fig. 1). IV. D ISCUSSION We tested the concept that magnetometers mounted at the wrist can detect the magnetic field produced by a ring worn on the finger, and then, be used to infer the angles of the wrist and finger joints. The angle estimates calculated from this approach correlated strongly with those calculated from a goniometric ex-oskeleton, although the finger flexion/extension estimates were least accurate. Accuracy levels were maintained a week after the initial calibration without recalibration. The system presented here is unique in several ways. The signal processing algorithm developed can convert low magnetic field strength signals (0.3–0.6 G) into hand and wrist joint estimates, while other systems have relied on high magnetic field strength signals (up to 33 G) [44], [47]. For this reason, we need only a small magnetic ring to generate the magnetic field. This is also apparently the first proposed system that can log finger and wrist angles in an unrestricted environment without the use of electronics on the fingers. B. Accuracy of the Manumeter We analyzed the accuracy of the manumeter in two ways. First, we compared its estimate of total joint distance traveled to that of the “gold standard” goniometric exoskeleton, and found it was 92%–98% accurate on average across subjects, with a 19%–28% standard deviation. Esse trabalho é wearable e obstrusivo. Difícil aplicabilidade},

  Abstract                 = {In addition to a broad range of different application areas, health games differ in the level of abstraction of the game’s message or goal and the way to achieve game benefits. Most games focus on teaching knowledge or prevention topics. Furthermore, some games focus on strengthening motivation of patients to attend a specific medication or to change their daily behavior in order to live healthier. In this paper we present the health game ‘‘Balance’’, developed to optimize the self-management of teenagers with diabetes mellitus type-I. Two versions of the game were implemented: A version explicitly referring to diabetes and an implicit version of ‘‘Balance’’ with no diabetes content in order to reduce diabetes related reactance among juveniles. In a between-subjects experimental study with a clinical sample the two versions were compared. Results demonstrate, contrary to expectations, that the explicit game version yielded higher game enjoyment than the implicit version.},

Nesse trabalho é apresentado o Kinnect como um sensor capaz de extrair informações de movimento de todas as partes do corpo. - Eless desenvolveram um baateria para instalar uma base e monitorar o movimento em casa. - A análise do movimento humano se mostrou como um importante indicador de saúde aplicado em diversos contextos como: diabetes, doenças neurológicas e detecção/predição de quedas. - É proposto um sistema de baixo custo, não intrusivo que pode mensurar com precisãõ o movimento por intermédio do Kinect - Preciso e não invasivo, existem diversas aplicações de diagnóstico, monitoramento, tratamento e reabilitação. Tais aplicações permitem incluir diagnóstico precoce, avaliação e gerenciamento medicamentoso em casa, otimizando o tratatamento. A técnica utilizada no artigo, usa informação de toddo o corpo para melhorar a precisão. Além do mais, eles conseguem demonstrar medições da cinemática do braço, parâmetros que são úteis apra aplciações médicas. Nesse trabalho os autores demonstraram a habilidade de extrair um conjunto ricos de parâmetros, como o swing do braço por exemplo. Além do mais essa proposta é não intrusiva dependendo do uso como um sensor posto numa posição fixa na casa. -Nesse trabalho o autor testou a robustez e acurácia do esqueleto disponibilizado pelo Kinnect e comprovou sua eficácia para aplicações de diagnóstico e monitoramento de saúde.},

  Abstract                 = {Wireless sensor networks are going to allow for ubiquitous health monitoring, improving users' well-being, the healthcare system, and helping to quickly react on emergency situations. Meeting the strict security needs of these ubiquitous medical applications is a big challenge, since safety and privacy of medical data has to be guaranteed all the way from the sensor nodes to the back-end services, the system has to fulfill latency needs, and lots of mobility is expected. In this paper, we introduce a deployment model for wireless sensor networks for pervasive healthcare based on the concepts of patient area networks and medical sensor networks, and propose a complete and efficient security framework for them. Our security framework is organized into three layers, addressing the operational requirements and security needs at the patient area network, medical sensor network and back-end levels. We specify how these layers are interconnected with each other as well as the needed security mechanisms that allow for the efficient and practical deployment of secure pervasive healthcare systems based on wireless sensor networks.},

Tanto usuários quanto médicos devem autenticar qualquer acesso ou escrita das informações médicas. Esses requisitos de segurança são requeridos pela HITRUST e as diretivas legais da HIPAA ============================== O autor propõe um framework para sistemas pervasivos baseados em WSN. Combinanando uma uma solução centralizada e distribuída balanceando performance e os requisitos de segurança. O framework possui uma arquitetura de segurança em três camadas: 1. Gerenciamento de segurança da MSN 2. Gerenciamento de Segurança da PAN 3. Gerenciamento de segurança dos mecanismos de back-end ==== O staff médico pode se comunicar a qualquer PAN, mesmo que tanto PAN e médicos estejam em constante movimento. PAN Security Layer: permite que o usuário gerencie a segurança sua própria pan, permitindo que ele conceda ou negue o acesso aos dados ao interatgir ocm a MSNs e os sistemas de Back End. The Back-end services security layer, assegura que as operações sobre a PAN interaja entre as MSN controlando diversas organizações. O autor assumiu um modelo centralizado e simplificado baseado na infraestrutura de chave pública e gerenciamento de certificação de autoridade no gerenciamento do sistema de healthcare. MSN Security Layer ----------------------------- A abordagem básica dessa camada permitiu combinar um handshake de acordo e verificação leve de certificados. Security Handshake baseado em criptografia de chave pública requere alguns segundos dos sensores e um delay para evitar ataques DoS. PAN Security Layer ---------------------------- A segunda camada de segurança é centrada-no-paciente para controla a camada PAN enquanto interage com as MSNs, no instance que controla a MSNs associadas aos usuários das PAN asseguranca o link de comunicação entre eles. ===========================},

  Review                   = {Nesse artigo o autor defende que o uso comercial dos jogos de esporte e saúde têm-se tornado produtos de sucesso. Avaliações de trabalhos científicos como os de Baranowski e Kato, tem provado efeitos positivos quando os jogos são abordados em direções de modificar o comportamento dos jogadores. Trabalhos de Papastergiou, Kretchscman, Kliem e Wiemeyer também indicamo efeitos positivos para reabilitação com Wii Sports box ou o potencial do Wii Fit como treinamento para a prevenção e reabilitação. Contudo esses jogos têm limitações porque não são substitutos adequados dos esportes reais, e os obstáculos concretos desses sistemas pode personlizar e sustenatar uma motivação sustentávels desses jogos quando aplicados à saúde. Baseado nessa observação, esse trabalho prima em levantar as dificuldades e efeitos positivos em combinar os jogos sérios de esportes e saúde com as tecnologias de sensores, para a personalização e adaptação de jogos multiplayer. A partir da aplicação StoryTec, médicos, preparadores físicos e outros usuários podem definir o programa de exercício através de programas pre-configurados e base de dados das características individuais ou do grupo. Elaborando a Story Engine do jogo, essa engine serve como um control unit para diversor momentos do jogo, responsável em processar o controle de dados vitais restrito a camada de sensores da aplicação. Segundo o trabalho de Sinclair [12], os jogos comerciais de exergames, não deve utilizá-lo apenas como motivacional para a prática de exercício mas também para mensurar seu batimento cardíaco, reconhcer atividades via acelerômetros. Um dos problemas é que esses sinais não são considerados no gameplay dos exergames. Para esse propósito é proposto uma engine adaptativa que recupera os sinais vitais para influenciar diretamente no game-play. Personalização e Adaptação ================== O objetivo dessa abordagem é prover um ambiente adaptado e personalizado que considera informação estatístca (treinamento, logica) e dinâmica como os sinais vitais que potencialmente altera o comportamento do jogador. Conclusão ======= O objetivo dessa abordagem é prover um ambiente adaptado e personalizado que considera informação estatístca (treinamento, logica) e dinâmica como os sinais vitais que potencialmente altera o comportamento do jogador. Esse artigo introduz um conjunto de exergames que buscam motivar os jogadores a praticarem exercício de forma personalizada através dos dados capturados pelos sensores.},

  Review                   = {Motivation and Video Games Video games motivate a remarkable amount of goal-directed behavior. For example, every week well over 10 million players of the popular online game World of Warcraft forgo other opportunities for leisure and invest more than 225 million hours collaborating, exploring, and competing against one another in a virtual world. Why do so many people spend so much time engaged in such games? The immediate and most obvious answer is “because they are fun.” Indeed, video game play differs markedly from activities that are engaged in for some form of external reward (e.g., payment for work). According to SDT (Ryan & Deci, 2000b), behaviors pursued for their own sake or their inherent satisfaction are identified as intrinsically motivated, whereas those pursued to access desired end states or avoid aversive ones are understood as extrinsically motivated. For more than 3 decades, one subtheory of SDT, cognitive evaluation theory (CET), has guided research on intrinsic motivation in sports, education, and leisure domains. The motivational model we propose for video games is based on the premise that the principles of CET and SDT that have been applied to the study of intrinsically motivated behaviors are also relevant to the psychological functioning and well-being of players engaged with video games},

  Abstract                 = {Serious Games for Sport and Health are a promising chance to help people to improve their health. In this paper, we address the challenges of adding context awareness to Serious Games for Sport and Health. We propose a framework for social networks and web services that is specialized in capturing temporal and spatial context as well as vital parameters of a user. Our framework dynamically maps necessary e-Health services such as exergames. In this way, we assist a user to find the most appropriate health services according to his/her needs at anytime and anywhere. We present our initial proof of concept implementation of the framework, which includes new sensor based Serious Games for Sport and Health as well as our test results.},

  Review                   = {O autor apresenta um framework para construir informação baseada em contexto chamando de SocialAware. Esse framework foi testado numa aplicaçaõ de prova de conceito. Estudos multidisciplinares recentes, tem pesquisado no domínio de redes sensores sem-fio, smart phones, redes sociais e comunicação móvel. Esses estudos contribuíram em capturar sinais vitais como: batimento cardíaco, pressão sanguínea, nível de glicose e etc. Além disso, atividades como andar, dormir, dirigir, cair, correr falar e conversar com um amigo pode ser capturado assim como variáveis de ambiente como temperatura, humidade, localização, altitude e etc. Nesse artigo é apresentado uma integração com um conjunto de jogos sérios para o suporte ao esporte e a saúde e é utilizado a informação de contexto para o framework. Extrair informação de contexto através de sensores em serviços heterogêneos trás dois desafios. Primeiramente, requer extrair conteúdo de serviços distintis e análise de BSN. Segundo, extrair informação de redes sociais agregar e armazenar no repositório específico e extrair informação relevante num jogo sério ou serviço de saúde. Módulo de Extração de Conteúdo ===================== This module takes part in the actual content extraction process from heterogeneous Internet-based services and body sensor network. Módulo de Extração de Contexto ===================== Esse módulo emprega o padrão de design MVC2 para encontrar valores de contexto baseados em serviço. O Context Extrator extrai informações da BSN e dos serviços através de seus controladores. Módulo de Serviço de Adaptação Dinâmica =========================== Para compor as primitivas de contexto no desenvolvimento do portal de rede social chamado SenseFace, é utilizado para mapear um subconjunto de jogos sérios e/ou serviços de saúde. E através da Ubiquity Stack provê uma subcamada de rede ubíqua para cada pessoa. Essa pilha provê a lógica, protocolos e algoritmos para extrair as informações de esporte e saúde dos dados personalizados dos serviços. Implementação ========== Devido a todas as camadas da pilha serem implementadas em PHP, foi usado um framework PHP chamado XAMPP, que atua diretamente no servidor WEB. A Gui foi implementada usando um Web Portal open Source denominado iMoogle, que utiliza PHP e JSON. O sistema armazena as informações vitais [17, 15, 21] como sensores foram utilizados po relógio Ez-430 Chronos Sports e a bicicleta ergométrica Daum 8008 TRS 3. A partir desses dispositivos foi possível mensurar a atividade física de uma pessoa. Foi implementado uma interface RESTful para transmitir os dados do acelerômetro em tempo real [15]. Dessa maneira foi possível detectar longos períodos de calmaria e de exercício físico. A interface RESTful permite sugerir a execução de atividades como caminhar, jogar determinado game, pilates. Test Results ======== Para avaliar a efetividade do sistema proposta foram conduzidos uma amostra de 95 pessas 25% de mulheres e conduziram entre 15 de maio de 2010 a 30 de novembro de 2010. A maior dos usuários possuíam mais de 25 anos e 45 usuários menos de 25 anos. Todos os participantes utilizam serviço de internet em diferentes escalas nos útlims 4 a 6 anos. A idéia do serviço dinâmico sugere que os exercícios físicos sugeridos através do jogo sério foi fortemente aceitado por 65% dos usuários, 30% consentiram e somente 5% acharam inapropriado. Conclusão ======= O autor demonstrou que é possível desenvolver uma aplicação que use diferentes tecnologias para capturar o contexto e aplicá-lo para atividades físicas. E que essa aplicação foi aceita pela maioria dos usuários que acharam adequado praticar exercício físicos em determinados momentos. Inglês ==== The author presents a framework for building context-aware services, called Social Aware. The framework has been tested with two proof-of-concept applications. Recent advancements in multidisciplinary research domains such as wireless sensors, smartphones, high speed personal area networking and mobile communication have contributed to a new era of context-aware computing. Extracting user context from sensory data and multimedia information contained within heterogeneous services poses two challenges. First, it requires live extraction of multimedia content from heterogeneous services and from BSN for context analysis. Second, employing appropriate logic to extract contextual information from the available social network and sensory data, aggregate and then store them to a repository to be used for dynamic selection of relevant serious games and health services. For better representation of the concept, we describe the framework with three logical modules. The first module deals with the extraction of multimedia data from different services over the web and live sensory data from one’s BSN},

  Abstract                 = {In a 5-year, double-blind study, subjects with Parkinson's disease ({PD)} who were randomized to initial treatment with ropinirole had a significantly lower incidence of dyskinesia compared with subjects randomized to levodopa, although Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale ({UPDRS)} motor scores were significantly more improved in the levodopa group. Subjects who completed the original study were eligible to participate in a long-term extension study conducted according to an open, naturalistic design and were evaluated approximately every 6 months until they had been followed for a total of 10 years. Comparing subjects randomized to initial treatment with ropinirole (n = 42) and levodopa (n = 27), the incidence of dyskinesia was significantly lower in the ropinirole group (adjusted odds ratio [{OR]} = 0.3; 95\% confidence interval [{CI]:} 0.1, 1.0; P = 0.046) and the median time to dyskinesia was significantly longer (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.4; 95\% {CI:} 0.2, 0.8; P = 0.007). The incidence of at least moderate wearing off ("off" time {\textgreater}/=26\% of the awake day) was also significantly lower in the ropinirole group (adjusted {OR} = 0.3; 95\% {CI:} 0.09, 0.03; P = 0.03). There were no significant differences in change in {UPDRS} activities of daily living or motor scores, or scores for the 39-item {PD} questionnaire, Clinical Global Impression, or the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Early treatment decisions for individual patients depend largely on the anticipated risk of side effects and long-term complications. Both ropinirole and levodopa are viable treatment options in early {PD.}},

Unfortunately, many first-generation pervasive computing systems lack the ability to evolve as new technologies emerge or as an application domain matures. To address this limitation, the University of Florida's Mobile and Pervasive Computing Laboratory is developing programmable pervasive spaces in which a smart space exists as both a runtime environment and a software library. Service discovery and gateway protocols automatically integrate system components using generic middleware that maintains a service definition for each sensor and actuator in the space. The Gator Tech Smart House in Gainesville, Florida, is the culmination of more than five years of research in pervasive and mobile computing. The project's goal is to create assistive environments such as homes that can sense themselves and their residents and enact mappings between the physical world and remote monitoring and intervention services.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Our objective was to develop parameters for objective ambulatory measurements of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Twenty-three PD patients with mild to severe LID were submitted to a standardized protocol of 1-minute recordings during rest, talking, stress, and four activities of daily life (ADL). Patients were simultaneously monitored with portable multi-channel accelerometry (four pairs of bi-axial sensors mounted onto the most affected arm, leg, and at the trunk) and recorded by video. LID severity was assessed with a modified Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (m-AIMS). The signals were analyzed, and every 1/8-second interval the amplitude was obtained of the dominant frequency within 1-4 Hz and 4-8 Hz frequency bands (Amp1-4 and Amp4-8). For both measures, convergent validity, reproducibility, and responsiveness were determined.In absence of voluntary movements, a significant relation was found between Amp1-4 and Amp4-8 and m-AIMS. Repeated measurements during rest showed a high reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.90 [Amp1-4] and 0.86[Amp4-8]). The extent to which LID increased with talking and stress correlated significantly (p = 0.02) between the objective and clinical measures (intraclass correlation for differences = 0.67). During ADL, LID occurred in a similar frequency band as voluntary movements and only Amp1-4 and Amp4-8 of the trunk and leg sensor remained highly correlated with m-AIMS.Although objective measures of LID are reliable and responsive, they fail to distinguish LID from voluntary movements. These measures are of value only when obtained during rest (all sensor sites) or during ADL when derived from those body segments that are normally not involved in these ADL tasks (trunk and leg).

If we would exercise regularly, eat healthy, control our weight, sleep enough, manage stress, not smoke and use alcohol only moderately, 90% of type II diabetes, 80% of coronary heart disease, and 70% of stroke could be prevented. Health statistics show that lifestyle related diseases are increasing at an alarming rate. Public health promotion campaigns and healthcare together are not effective enough to stop this "tsunami". The solution that is offered is to empower people to manage their health with the assistance of ICT-enabled services. A lot of R&D and engineering effort is being invested in Personal Health Systems. Although some progress has been made, the market for such systems has not yet emerged. The aim of this critical review is to identify the barriers which are holding back the growth of the market. It looks into the theoretical foundations of behavior change support, the maturity of the technologies for behavior change support, and the business context in which behavior change support systems are used.},

But that promise can only be realized if the MICT applications are used by the medical staff. This paper reports on a study examining nurses' decisions to utilize MICTs. A mixed-methods approach is used, consisting of both qualitative and quantitative elements, that reveals and empirically tests the significance of novel constellations of fit (i.e., identification, information, patient interaction, physical, time criticality, user comfort, and workflow fit) and individual characteristics, presented as basic human drives (i.e., drive to acquire, bond, defend, and learn). Findings indicate that fit is a multi-faceted construct and that archetypical human drives have an influence on these various notions, which in turn, impact technology adoption in the healthcare context.},

  Abstract                 = {Obesity and diabetes have reached epidemic proportions in both developing and developed nations. While doctors and caregivers stress the importance of physical exercise in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, many people have difficulty subscribing to a healthy lifestyle. Virtual reality games offer a potentially exciting aid in accelerating and sustaining behavior change. However, care needs to be taken to develop sustainable models of employing games for the management of diabetes and obesity. In this article, we propose an integrative gaming paradigm designed to combine multiple activities involving physical exercises and cognitive skills through a game-based storyline. The persuasive story acts as a motivational binder that enables a user to perform multiple activities such as running, cycling, and problem solving. These activities guide a virtual character through different stages of the game. While performing the activities in the games, users wear sensors that can measure movement (accelerometers, gyrometers, magnetometers) and sense physiological measures (heart rate, pulse oximeter oxygen saturation). These measures drive the game and are stored and analyzed on a cloud computing platform. A prototype integrative gaming system is described and design considerations are discussed. The system is highly configurable and allows researchers to build games for the system with ease and drive the games with different types of activities. The capabilities of the system allow for engaging and motivating the user in the long term. Clinicians can employ the system to collect clinically relevant data in a seamless manner.},

  Review                   = {Esse trabalho está bastante semelhante ... Pois envolve, acelerômetros, giroscópios, magnetometerer. Percepção cognitiva do jogador, batimento cardíaco, oxímetro e saturação de oxigênio. Foi desenvolvido um protótipo para discussões e permite que os pesquisadores construam jogos para mensurar os diferentes tipos de atividades. Jogos e realidade virtual , permitem endereçar uma oportunidade para o gerenciamento e prevenção de doenças crônicas. O gerenciamento da diabetes requer uma grande mudança de comportamento. Em terceiro lugar os jogos encorajam as mudanças das práticas nutricionais. Nós discutimos previamente e identificamos essas oportunidades ao empregar nos jogos. Os jogos permitem a jovens e adultos a aderirem ao tratamento da diabetes. Goodyear e Kahn exploraram um trabalho sobre a efetividade dos exercícios físicos para o tratamento de diabéticos (insulinos dependentes ou não) Diversos trabalhos mostram que o exercício físico e o controle de glicose permitem reduzir as maiores complicações da doença. Os pesquisadores rastream a usabilidade do jogo, o grau de entretenimento e a utilidade clínica do jogo. Os usuários mostram o reflexos de todos esses parâmetros. O trabalho de Southard demonstram que os jogos podem ser empregados para aumentar a atividade física de crianças. Eles desenvolveram um jogo baseado em pedometros e informação nas nuvens chamado de MetaKenKoh. Chen mostrou que os movimentos medidos pelos acelerômetros podem prever a energia gasta por pacientes de diabetes. Em um outro estudo Sorenson mostrou que o VO2 max pode ser estimado a partir do monitoramento dos batimentos cardíacos. sso significa que através do monitoramento do batimento cardíaco é possível estimar a quantidade de energia gasta no jgoo Segundo o autor a idéia do integrative gaming system é linkar as atividades com atividades que façam medição da glicose, ingestão de insulina, executar exercícios físicos e condução de resolução de problemas, através de uma linha de estória. Através da computação os pacientes poderam conduzir o sistema. Através de TVS lcds ter uma melhor performance através de um cenário de jogo persuasivo. Jogos geralmente possuem um SHORT SHELF-LIFE e normalmente o custo de desenvolvimento ultrapassa os benefícios do jogo a longo prazo. O modelo de jogo permite configurar o tipo de exercício físico a ser executado. Permitindo realizar um treinamento cardiovascular por exemplo. Nesse protótipo cada exercício pode ser visualizado em estágios do jogo ligando com as diferentes atividades. Exeperimentos recentes indicam o impacto dos exercícios cognitivos e treinamento cardiovascular no Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, prevenindo o declínio das funções cognitivas. o paciente veste um wireless heart rate sensor. Os sensores de movimento são empregados através da Movea Sensor, que são integradas ao acelerômetro, gyroscópio e magnetometer, Os batimentos cardíacos são medidos através do oxímetro ====================================== DIFERENÇA PRINCIPAL DO MEU TRABALHO ? ====================================== O trabalho é voltado para promover a atividade física para pacientes com diabetes. O sistema é adaptativo de acordo com o nível de dificuldade e habilidade do paciente. A proposta do sistema foi integrar o tratamento da diabetes ao jogo ====================================== Correlacionado ====================================== A abordagem permite a integração com os registros médicos que estariam disponíveis nas nuvens.},

Tailor-made games help patients be more adherent to treatment regimens and train doctors how to manage patients in different clinical situations. In this review, examples in the scientific literature of commercially available and tailor-made games used for education and training with patients and medical students and doctors are summarized. There is a history of using video games with patients from the early days of gaming in the 1980s, and this has evolved into a focus on making tailor-made games for different disease groups, which have been evaluated in scientific trials more recently. Commercial video games have been of interest regarding their impact on surgical skill. More recently, some basic computer games have been developed and evaluated that train doctors in clinical skills. The studies presented in this article represent a body of work outlining positive effects of playing video games in the area of health care.},

  Abstract                 = {{OBJECTIVE.} Suboptimal adherence to self-administered medications is a common problem. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a video-game intervention for improving adherence and other behavioral outcomes for adolescents and young adults with malignancies including acute leukemia, lymphoma, and soft-tissue sarcoma. {METHODS.} A randomized trial with baseline and 1- and 3-month assessments was conducted from 2004 to 2005 at 34 medical centers in the United States, Canada, and Australia. A total of 375 male and female patients who were 13 to 29 years old, had an initial or relapse diagnosis of a malignancy, and currently undergoing treatment and expected to continue treatment for at least 4 months from baseline assessment were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The intervention was a video game that addressed issues of cancer treatment and care for teenagers and young adults. Outcome measures included adherence, self-efficacy, knowledge, control, stress, and quality of life. For patients who were prescribed prophylactic antibiotics, adherence to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was tracked by electronic pill-monitoring devices (n = 200). Adherence to 6-mercaptopurine was assessed through serum metabolite assays (n = 54). {RESULTS.} Adherence to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 6-mercaptopurine was greater in the intervention group. Self-efficacy and knowledge also increased in the intervention group compared with the control group. The intervention did not affect self-report measures of adherence, stress, control, or quality of life. {CONCLUSIONS.} The video-game intervention significantly improved treatment adherence and indicators of cancer-related self-efficacy and knowledge in adolescents and young adults who were undergoing cancer therapy. The findings support current efforts to develop effective video-game interventions for education and training in health care.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND} Ten-year follow-up results from the Parkinson's Disease Research Group of the United Kingdom trial demonstrated that there were no long-term advantages to initiating treatment with bromocriptine compared with l-dopa in early Parkinson disease ({PD).} Increased mortality in patients on selegiline combined with l-dopa led to premature termination of this arm after 6 years. {METHODS} Between 1985 and 1990, 782 patients were recruited into an open pragmatic multicenter trial and were randomized to l-dopa/decarboxylase inhibitor ({DDCI)}, l-{dopa/DDCI} plus selegiline, or bromocriptine. The main endpoints were mortality, disability, and motor complications. For final follow-up, health-related quality of life and mental function were also assessed. {RESULTS} Median duration of follow-up at final assessment was 14 years in the 166 (21\%) surviving participants who could be contacted. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, disability scores were better in the l-dopa than in the bromocriptine arm (Webster: 16.6 vs 19.8; p = 0.03; Northwestern University Disability: 34.3 vs 30.0, p = 0.05). Physical functioning (difference 20.8; 95\% {CI} 10.0, 31.6; p {\textless} 0.001) and physical summary scores (difference 5.2; 95\% {CI} 0.7, 9.7; p = 0.03) on the 36-item short-form health survey were also superior on l-dopa. Differences in mortality rates and prevalence of dyskinesias, motor fluctuations, and dementia were not significantly different. {CONCLUSION} Initial treatment with the dopamine agonist bromocriptine did not reduce mortality or motor disability and the initially reduced frequency in motor complications was not sustained. We found no evidence of a long-term benefit or clinically relevant disease-modifying effect with initial dopamine agonist treatment.},

  Abstract                 = {{We developed an algorithm that distinguishes between on and off states in patients with Parkinson's disease during daily life activities. Twenty-three patients were monitored continuously in a home-like situation for approximately 3 hours while they carried out normal daily-life activities. Behavior and comments of patients during the experiment were used to determine the on and off periods by a trained observer. Behavior of the patients was measured using triaxial accelerometers, which were placed at six different positions on the body. Parameters related to hypokinesia (percentage movement), bradykinesia (mean velocity), and tremor (percentage peak frequencies above 4 Hz) were used to distinguish between on and off states. The on-off detection was evaluated using sensitivity and specificity. The performance for each patient was defined as the average of the sensitivity and specificity. The best performance to classify on and off states was obtained by analysis of movements in the frequency domain with a sensitivity of 0.97 and a specificity of 0.97. We conclude that our algorithm can distinguish between on and off states with a sensitivity and specificity near 0.97. This method, together with our previously published method to detect levodopa-induced dyskinesia, can automatically assess the motor state of Parkinson's disease patients and can operate successfully in unsupervised ambulatory conditions.}},

The effectiveness of levodopa is evident, but earlier use and higher doses are causative of the emergence of motor fluctuations. About one half of patients develop motor fluctuations 4-6 years after starting levodopa therapy for parkinsonian symptoms. Peripheral and central pharmacokinetic mechanisms are related to motor fluctuations. It was reported that time to peak concentration (Tmax) and elimination half-life (T(1/2)) of levodopa decreased especially in patients with wearing-off (peripheral pharmacokinetics). On the other hand, there are several reports demonstrating no change in peripheral pharmacokinetics in patients on long-term levodopa therapy. The reduced capacity for presynaptic storage of dopamine by nigral neurons is believed to be another important factor responsible for motor fluctuations (central pharmacokinetics). In addition, a mathematical model that was recently established based on the hypothesis that dopamine release is subject to probabilistic variations in the quantity of dopamine has indicated that motor fluctuations might be explained by presynaptic mechanisms. On the other hand, several studies demonstrated that changes in postsynaptic mechanisms (pharmacodynamics) play an important role in shortening the duration of levodopa action in advanced stages. In clinical practice therapeutic strategies for motor fluctuations are focused on continuous dopaminergic stimulation at postsynaptic dopamine receptors. Once motor fluctuations appear, therapeutic regimens should be individualized to retain optimal control of the symptoms based on accurate assessment of each patient's levodopa cycle and responses to drugs.

Due to the nature of the sensing and communication mechanisms, these monitoring sensors are susceptible to errors and failures. In this paper, we address the issue of identifying and isolating faulty sensors in a Body Sensor Network that is used for remote monitoring of daily living activities.

In this review, we present some representative applications in the healthcare domain and describe the challenges they introduce to wireless sensor networks due to the required level of trustworthiness and the need to ensure the privacy and security of medical data. These challenges are exacerbated by the resource scarcity that is inherent with wireless sensor network platforms. We outline prototype systems spanning application domains from physiological and activity monitoring to large-scale physiological and behavioral studies and emphasize ongoing research challenges.},

  Review                   = {---- MUITO BOM O ARTIGO - UM SURVEY DA AREA ---- Pontos importantes: Trustworthiness: ------------------------- como é baseado em redes sensores sem fio que sofrem interferência, um ponto importante é a confiabilidade do dado adquirido pela rede sensor. The impact of obstacles and interference is exacerbated by the fact that most wireless sensor network systems use ow-power radios to achieve long system lifetimes Considering that wireless sensing systems for healthcare will be used by the elderly and medical staff with little training, loss in quality due to operator misuse is a big concern. Privacy and Security ------------------------------- Wireless sensor networks in healthcare are used to determine the activities of daily living (ADL) and provide data for longitudinal studies. The first privacy challenge encountered is the vague specification of privacy. The Heath Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) by the U.S. Government is one attempt to define this term [1]. Fortunately, many solutions with different tradeoffsare possible for this type of physical layer attack. Suchsolutions include 1) attenuating the signal outside of the home to increase the packet loss ratio of the eavesdropper, 2) periodically transmitting radio messages whether or not the device has data to be sent, 3) randomly delaying radio messages to hide the time that the corresponding events occurred, 4) hiding the fingerprint of the transmitter, and 5) transmitting fake data to emulate a real event. By proposing to design a self-healing system with the presence and detection of attacks, rather than trying to build a completely secure system [77] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Medical sensors combine transducers for detecting electrical, thermal, optical, chemical, genetic, and other signals with physiological origin with signal processing algorithms to estimate features indicative of a person’s health status. Sensors beyond those that directly measure health state have also found use in the practice of medicine. Existem avanços nas tecnologias de monitoramento de pacientes: - Sensing modality: Advances in technologies such as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), imaging, and microfluidic and nanofluidic lab-on-chip are leading to new forms of chemical, biological, and genomic sensing and analyses available outside the confines of a laboratory at the point of care. - Size and cost: Most medical sensors have traditionally been too costly and complex to be used outside of clinical environments. However, recent advances in microelectronics and computing have made many forms of medical sensing more widely accessible to individuals at their homes, work places, and other living spaces. ---- futuro : - Finally, we are seeing the emergence of implantable medical sensors for continuously measuring internal health status and physiological signals. In some cases, the purpose is to continuously monitor health parameters that are not externally available, such as intraoccular pressure in glaucoma patients [20]. The goal in other cases is to use the measurements as triggers for physiological interventions that prevent impending adverse events (e.g., epileptic seizures [62]) and for physical assistance (e.g., brain-controlled motor prosthetics [47]). Given their implantable nature, these devices face severe size constraints and need to communicate and receive power wirelessly. Connectivity: Driven by advances in information technology, medical sensors have become increas- ingly interconnected with other devices. Early medical sensors were largely isolated with inte- grated user interfaces for displaying their measure- ments. Subsequently, sensors became capable of interfacing to external devices via wired interfaces such as RS 232, USB, and Ethernet. More recently, medical sensors have incorporated wireless con- nections, both short range, such as Bluetooth, Zigbee, and near-field radios to communicate wirelessly to nearby computers, personal digital assistants, or smartphones, and long range, such as WiFi or cellular communications, to communicate directly with cloud computing services. Therefore, such sensors can also record measurements in nonvolatile memory for upload- ing at a later time when they can be shared with healthcare personnel and further analyzed. B. Wireless Sensor Platforms Embedded computing platforms used for healthcare applications range from smartphones to specialized wireless sensing platforms, known as motes, If such a device is active for 1% of the time, its average power consumption is just a few microwatts enabling long-term operation with two AA batteries. Motes are usually equipped with low-power radios such as those compliant with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for wireless sensor networks [33]. III . HE ALTHCARE APPLICATIONS Wirelessly networked sensors enable dense spatio– temporal sampling of physical, physiological, psychologi- cal, cognitive, and behavioral processes in spaces ranging from personal to buildings to even larger scale ones. In what follows, we introduce a list of healthcare applications enabled by these technologies. - Monitoring in mass-casualty disasters: - Vital sign monitoring in hospitals: - At-home and mobile aging: ========== Wirelessly net- worked sensors embedded in people’s living spaces or carried on the person can collect information about personal physical, physiological, and behav- ioral states and patterns in real-time and every- where. Such data can also be correlated with social and environmental context. From such Bliving records,[ useful inferences about health and well- being can be drawn. This can be used for self- awareness and individual analysis to assist in making behavior changes, and to share with caregivers for early detection and intervention. At the same time such procedures are effective and economic ways of monitoring age-related illnesses. ====== - Large-scale in-field medical and behavioral studies: Body-worn sensors together with sensor-equipped Internet-connected smartphones have begun to revolutionize medical and public health research studies by enabling behavioral and physiological data to be continually collected from a large num- ber of distributed subjects as they lead their day to day lives. With their ability to provide insight into subject states that cannot be replicated in con- trolled clinical and laboratory settings and that cannot be measured from computer-assisted retro- spective self-report methods, such sensing systems are becoming critical to medical, psychological, and behavioral research. Indeed, a major goal of the exposure biology program under National Institute of Health (NIH) Genes and Environment Initiative (GEI) is to develop such field deployable sensing tools to quantify exposures to environment (e.g., psychosocial stress, addiction, toxicants, diet, phys- ical activity) objectively, automatically, and for days at a time in the participants’ natural environments. Researchers, both within the GEI program (e.g., [35], [45], and [58]) and elsewhere (e.g., [27], [55], and [63]), have also recognized the utility of such sensing in making measurements for longitudinal studies ranging from the scale of individuals to large populations. ---------------- ESSE É O FOCO PEGAR ESSAS REFERENCIAS: [35], [45], [58][27], [55],[63]), The last critical dimension is the type of wireless networking and sensing technologies that are used: on- body sensors with long-range radios, body-area networks of short-range on-body sensors with a long-range gateway, sensors implanted in-body with wireless communication and power delivery, wireless sensors embedded in assistive devices carried by individuals, wireless sensors embedded in the environment, and sensors embedded in the ubiq- uitous mobile smartphones.

Second, we identify a privacy framework for mobile healthcare and home-care systems. Third, we extract a set of privacy properties intended for use by those who design systems and applications for mobile healthcare and home-care systems, linking them back to the privacy principles. Finally, we list several important research questions that the community should address.

  Abstract                 = {Parkinson's disease is classified as a chronic movement disorder. The incidence of Parkinson's disease is proportional to age. The status of Parkinson's disease is characterized through the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale is an ordinal scale, for which the scale is qualitatively evaluated. The inherent issue of the ordinal scale is the lack of a temporal parameter to evaluate the attributes of the movement disorder. The evaluation of the Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale requires clinical specialization, occurring in a clinical environment. Accelerometers, through the advent of miniaturization, have reached a capacity to advance the evaluation of Parkinson's disease. Tremor characteristics and temporal attributes of Parkinson's disease can be readily quantified. Accelerometer systems have been tested and evaluated for ascertaining general status, drug therapy efficacy, and amelioration of Parkinson's disease based on deep brain stimulation parameter settings. Further advance of the accelerometer characterization of Parkinson's disease attributes involves the incorporation of a fully wearable system. Such a system is possible with the integration of wireless {3D} {MEMS} accelerometers. The device proposed incorporates a wireless and potentially wearable {3D} {MEMS} accelerometer mounted on the dorsum of the hand. The wireless {3D} {MEMS} accelerometer system can potentially track the Parkinson's disease status through out real time for a subject at the home-based setting of the subject. An implication of the device is a subject database can be generated quantifying the progression of Parkinson's disease. Drug therapy dosage may be optimized with quantified feedback from the wireless {3D} {MEMS} accelerometer system. Deep brain stimulation parameters may be further refined, and the conceptual foundation for real time deep brain stimulation parameter optimization is established. Enclosed is the initial test and evaluati- - on of the wireless {3D} {MEMS} accelerometer system through the quantification of simulated tremor.},

However, the performances of SVMs are based on choosing the proper kernel functions or proper parameters of a kernel function. It is extremely time consuming by applying the k-fold cross-validation (CV) to choose the almost best parameter. Nevertheless, the searching range and fineness of the grid method should be determined in advance. In this paper, an automatic method for selecting the parameter of the normalized kernel function is proposed. In the experimental results, it costs very little time than k-fold cross-validation for selecting the parameter by our proposed method. Moreover, the corresponding SVMs can obtain more accurate or at least equal performance than SVMs by applying k-fold cross-validation to determine the parameter.},

Our system constructs the lower limbs skeleton and kinematic model for calculating the walking gait features such as average walking step length, velocity, width and joint angles. When the user suffer in abnormal gait, the robotic walker assists user to stabilize their gaits through the adjustable control motion of walker according to the user's walking gait and prompting user with auditory cues. In experiment, we had invited Parkinson's Disease patients to test our system in senior care unit, the experimental results show that when the patients have relatively stable gait than without using this system.},

  Review                   = {Esse artigo apresenta uma ferramenta que faz o mapeamento de contexto de atividades clínicas através de uma ontologia pré-definida. (Pouco vai contribuir com o trabalho). -------------------- Nesse cenário, uma pesquisa sendo desenvolvida no escopo do projeto ClinicSpace visa propor componentes para a modelagem do contexto clinico no âmbito da computação Ubíqua em Saúde e desenvolver uma ferramenta que possibilite ao usuário-final declarar o contexto de sua atividade de forma gráfica, permitindo ao sistema de suporte a geração automática de código para o gerenciamento das aplicações na arquitetura ClinicSpace [Ferreira et al. 2009]. Um dos desafios da Computação Ciente do Contexto é interpretar a grande quantidade de informação disponível e conseguir determinar ações a partir da interpretação dessas informações. O contexto clínico até o momento está vinculado às entidades médico, paciente, sensor, dispositivo, espaço, atividades ou tarefas, recursos e tempo, informações temporais, atemporais e deduzidas. Levam-se em conta as informações coletadas pelos sensores, informações disponibilizadas pelo sistema eletrônico de saúde (pEHR – pervasive Electronic Health Record) e informações deduzidas através da composição das duas informações conhecidas. O médico contendo uma atividade ao qual vai executar, interage com o sistema pervasivo através de um dispositivo (móvel ou não) em um espaço pervasivo, tal espaço disponibiliza para o dispositivo utilizado recursos (impressoras, rede wireless ...), o espaço pervasivo está repleto de sensores, os quais monitoram as entidades existentes no ambiente. Tais sensores contem atuadores, que possibilitam criar filtros para as informações obtidas, vindo assim a disparar ações automáticas pré-definidas anteriormente. Sensores também estão vinculados a médico e paciente, pois monitoram suas funções vitais (temperatura, pressão, batimentos cardíacos ...). O tempo somente existe quando a atividade que o médico vai realizar é executada. A concepção da ferramenta foi feita através da construção de uma aplicação desenvolvida em Java, através dos componentes visuais Swing. Tal ferramenta utiliza uma interface gráfica amigável para usuários que já estejam familiarizados com outras ferramentas de geração de código UML padrão. O projeto Activity-Based Computing [Christensen and Bardram 2007] apresenta uma proposta para utilização de Computação baseada em Tarefas destinada a Ambientes de Saúde.},

This paper explores the potential for use of an unaugmented commodity technology - the mobile phone - as a health promotion tool. We describe a prototype application that tracks the daily exercise activities of people carrying phones, using fluctuation in signal strength to estimate a user's movement. In a short-term study of the prototype that shared activity information amongst groups of friends, we found that awareness encouraged reflection on, and increased motivation for, daily activity. We describe some of the details of the pilot study, and conclude with our intended plans to develop the system further in order to carry out a longer-term clinical trial},

  Abstract                 = {As we observe society in our days, we can see that people live longer; this means that we have an older population. As we know, elder are more likely to have health issues. The special needs presented by elder are gaining a major concern from all of us. Another tendency of our society is the lack of time that people demonstrate and, as a consequence, the lack of time reflects when families can't take care of their own elders. Many solutions are being presented in order to solve this problem. Some of them are taking advantage of the new technology developments in body sensor network area. In this paper we proposed an architecture of a system called Elder Care. The Elder Care solution has two primary goals: monitoring vital signs, sending alerts to family and specialized help and provide a social network in order to wrap all elder to avoid social isolation.},

  Review                   = {The Elder Care solution has two primary goals: - monitoring vital signs, sending alerts to family and specialized help - provide a social network in order to wrap all elder to avoid social isolation. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As an emerging problem, providing a better life for elder people and be able to reduce health costs, many solutions The major importance of solutions to deal with elder people is so extreme that there are innumerous projects in development referred in [16] and [17]: OLDES (Older People's e-services at home), CAALYX (Complete Ambient Assisting Living EXperiment) , K4CARE (Knowledge-based HomeCare eServices for an ageing Europe), ALADIN (Ambient Lighting Assistance for an Ageing Population), ENABLE (A wearable system supporting services to enable elderly people to live well, independently and at ease), SHARE-IT (Supported human autonomy for recovery and enhancement of cognitive and motor abilities using information technologies), EASY LINE The solutions mentioned above are focused on the physical well being of the patient, monitoring vital signs. Many elder live alone in their homes, isolated, lonely, with no activities what so ever. Arquitetura Proposta --------------------------------- The proposed architecture is divided in 3 primary modules: local monitoring, control center and virtual leisure room (visible in Figure 1). The local monitoring will be installed at patient’s home, getting vital signs and sending them to the control center that will be responsible for setting in motion the proper alerts and specialized help as a response to abnormal situations. 3.1. Local Monitoring -------------------------------- Local monitoring, represented in Figure 3, will be installed in elder people’s home. It will acquire vital signs from body wireless sensor, in a non invasive method, and send the abnormal information and samples of normal information to the control center through a communication network. The vital signs to monitor are: blood pressure, ocular pressure, ECG, fall detection and body fluids. This choice was made after some interviews to doctors and nurses staff that indicated these parameters as the more important to survey in elder people. They emphases fall detection as one of the most important parameters, indicating that a fall can mean that the elder had a breakdown and needs immediate assistance. 3.2 Control Center ---------------------------- The control center, represented in Figure 4, will receive the information from all local monitoring. Additionally to the fact of being an information repository, the control center manages all the alerts; meaning that, it is possible to compare current data with the patient record’s and check what parameters are abnormal and inform the family as well as activate proper emergency responses. This allows having a personalized response for each case because, besides the incoming alert, the control center has all the medical records and previous alerts of each patient. Comunication --------------------- The communications with National Health System is going to be developed using a standard protocol like HL7, DICOM, HIPAA, CEN/TC 251 (WGIII) - Security, Safety and Quality, ISO TC 215 (WG 4) - Security, IEEE P1157 Medical Data Interchange (MEDIX), IEEE P1073 Medical Information Bus (MIB) [18] [19], according to the country where the solution will be implemented. 3.3. Virtual Leisure Room --------------------------------------- As people are getting older, they have a propensity to isolate themselves at home mostly by physical movement difficulties. As a consequence, they start to feel sad and to be a burden to society by not being able to contribute somehow. The virtual leisure room promotes a social relationship between all elder from Elder Care solution in order to prevent social seclusion (Figure 5). The virtual leisure room is going to be conceived to cover most of elder, including people illiterate and with some motor disabilities but cannot be applied to elder that have degenerative mental illnesses, such as Alzheimer. The virtual leisure room will also offer the opportunity to the users to expose their doubts to doctors, nurses and medical staff. This is a benefit because elder people feel, many times, embarrassment to ask personally some questions to their own doctors. This feature will allow that users pose some questions without having to meet the doctor in person. With Elder Care solution we will be able to maintain elders in their homes, surveying their health and make them useful by interaction in the virtual leisure room. Conclusão ---------------- O trabalho foi realizado uma pesquisa qualitativa para a proposta de uma arquitetura: We followed a qualitative research with semi structured interviews in order to obtain the requirements necessary to the proposed architecture.},

  Abstract                 = {As healthcare in many countries faces an aging population and rising costs, mobile Health (mHealth) sensing technologies promise a new opportunity. However, the privacy concerns associated with mHealth sensing are a limiting factor for their widespread adoption. The use of wireless body area networks pose a particular challenge. Although there exist protocols that provide a secure and private communication channel between two devices, the large transmission overhead associated with these protocols limit their application to low-power mHealth sensing devices. We propose an adaptive security model that enables use of privacy-preserving protocols in low-power mHealth sensing by reducing the network overhead in the transmissions, while maintaining the security and privacy properties provided by the protocols.},

  Abstract                 = {Advances in information and communication technologies, ICT, are bringing new opportunities in the field of middleware systems oriented to ubiquitous environments and wearable devices used for patient telemonitoring. At a time of such challenges, this paper arises from the need to identify robust technical telemonitoring solutions that are both open and interoperable in home or mobile scenarios. These middleware systems demand standardized solutions to be cost effective and to take advantage of standardized operation and interoperability. Thus, a fundamental challenge is to design a plug-&-play platform that, either as individual elements or as components, can be incorporated in a simple way into different telecare systems, perhaps configuring a personal user network. Moreover, there is an increasing market pressure from companies not traditionally involved in medical markets, asking for a standard for personal health devices (PHD), which foresee a vast demand for telemonitoring, wellness, ambient assisted living (AAL) and applications for ubiquitous-health (u-health). However, the newly emerging situations imply very strict requirements for the protocols involved in the communication. The ISO/IEEE 11073 (X73) family of standards is adapting to new personal devices, implementing high quality sensors, and supporting wireless transport (e.g. Bluetooth) and the access to faster and reliable communication network resources. Its optimized version (X73-PHD) is adequate for this new technology snapshot and might appear the best-positioned international standards to reach this goal. This work presents an updated survey of this standard and its implementation in a middleware telemonitoring platform.},

  Abstract                 = {Lack of exercise is known to be detrimental to health, and various exercise machines that can be used indoors in a convenient manner are available. However, because expertise is required to ascertain which exercise to do and for how long, people sometimes sustain injuries by exercising excessively and find it difficult to sufficiently benefit from exercising. Therefore, fitness machines with automatic controls are being developed so that people can exercise efficiently, and exercise programs are being designed with game elements to encourage regular exercise. Monotonous exercise makes it difficult for people to experience a sense of accomplishment while exercising, and if the degree of difficulty is not set properly, people cannot perform the appropriate amount of exercise. The present study proposes a fitness game method in which heart rate is measured in real time while playing a game and the contents of the game are actively adjusted based on heart rate, thus allowing users to perform sufficient amounts of exercise and experience a sense of accomplishment. A fitness game based on boxercise movements was designed based on the present method and then evaluated.},

  Abstract                 = {The face of health care is changing as new technologies are being incorporated into the existing infrastructure. Electronic patient records and sensor networks for in-home patient monitoring are at the current forefront of new technologies. Paper-based patient records are being put in electronic format enabling patients to access their records via the Internet. Remote patient monitoring is becoming more feasible as specialized sensors can be placed inside homes. The combination of these technologies will improve the quality of health care by making it more personalized and reducing costs and medical errors. While there are benefits to technologies, associated privacy and security issues need to be analyzed to make these systems socially acceptable. In this paper we explore the privacy and security implications of these next-generation health care technologies. We describe existing methods for handling issues as well as discussing which issues need further consideration.},

Para essa pesquisa iremos focar somente no monitoramento de pacientes --------------- Trabalhos Correlatos ============== Intel’s Integrated Digital Hospital (IDH) is aimed at improving health care worldwide by linking people, processes and technologies [17]. The IDH system combines mobile point-of-care (MPOC) and other information technology to integrate patient and administrative information into a comprehensive, digital view of a patient’s health. The Information Technology for Assisted Living at Home (ITALH) project at University of California, Berkeley is looking at sensor networks for remote patient monitoring [6].This project aims to create a system based on wearable sensors that will allow people who require assistance to live at home to do so using information technology. Kansas State University and the University of Alabama in Huntsville have a combined effort working on Wide Area Body Networks (WABN) Infrastructures [12].They are developing wearable health status monitoring systems that can be used for in home patient monitoring. New sensors are also being developed to do different forms of monitoring. For example, wearable fall detectors that include accelerometers are being developed by ITALH [2]. In most of these systems, a periodic report from the sensors is sent back via wireless communication, using ZigBee, Bluetooth, or other technologies, to a local base station within the home. This local base station, e.g. a personal computer, evaluates the data sent back by the sensors. For example, if data of an abnormality in vital signs appears, the local base station can send the sensor data, along with an alarm, to a central monitoring station. This enables the health care providers at the central monitoring station to take the appropriate steps to aid the patient. The transmission of the information between the home and the monitoring site is done through the Internet. This type of system minimally restricts the patients daily activities, while still allowing him/her to be monitored. =========== These technologies will provide many benefits for health care delivery, yet there are a number of security and privacy implications that must be explored in order to promote and maintain fundamental medical ethical principles and social expectations. =================================== remote sensor networks for patient monitoring ISSUES =================================== A. Data Access and Storage There has long been concern over a patient’s health record privacy and confidentiality [5]. Connecting personal health information to the Internet exposes this data to more hostile attacks compared to the paper-based medical records. However, once this information is available electronically, it opens the door for hackers and other malicious attackers to access the records as well as those who are authorized. In addition, given the distributed nature of sensor networks for in-home patient monitoring, there is a greater challenge in ensuring data security and integrity compared to the traditional health care system. Eavesdropping and skimming are a possibility when the sensor data is transmitted wirelessly. Data access, storage, and integrity are key challenges when implementing EPRs and in-home sensor networks. The following questions need to be answered: ---------------- 1. Who owns the data? The question of ’who owns the data’ is particularly troublesome and unsettled.It has been the object of recurrent, highly- publicized lawsuits and congressional inquiries. Furthermore, some HMOs have been refusing to cover a patient’s expenses when the patient has participated in clinical treatment protocols that are experimental [3]. It is unclear what level of privacy and security protection must be maintained when data is transferred to a third party. 2. What type of data, and how much data, shouldbe stored? Doctors’ notes, MRIs, and lab test results are examples of data that is stored in patient’s paper- based record. Regarding EPRs, should all of this data be electronically stored or will a subset of this data be sufficient for health care purposes? For example, data may be aggregated and the results stored, and this may be enough information for the EPR users. 3. Where should the health data be stored? This is a question of centralized versus decentralized storage. In the case of EPRs, should data reside in local databases that can be connected to each other, or should it be stored in a central database? 4. Who can view a patient’s medical record? We divide the EPR users into two categories: a) users with the read/write privileges - such as the doctors and nurses, who can not only view a patient’s EPR, but can also edit the records. b) users with read ======================= 5. To whom should this information be disclosed to without the patient’s consent? ======================= There are situationsin which the patient’s health information needs to be disclosed to people other than the previously authorized users. For example, in the case of remote patient monitoring, an emergency might necessitate disclosure of health data without the patient’s consent in order for that patient to receive necessary care. ============================== Solutions ============================== 1. Role-based access control: one of the most challenging problems in managing large networks is the complexity of security administration [16]. 2. Encryption: Encryption can be used to ensure the security of the data and help prevent eavesdropping and skimming. Encryption can be accomplished in hardware as well as in software. 3. Authentication Mechanisms: Authentication mechanisms can be used to ensure the data is coming from the person/entity it is claiming to be from [11]. =========== Future Work =========== Policy development: New policy needs to be created that can deal with across state jurisdiction. While the HIPAA Privacy Rules provide some groundwork, more needs to be done to create clear rules that users can rely upon.},

  Abstract                 = {In a world where competitors are just a mouse-click away, human-centered design (HCD) methods change from a last minute add-on to a vital part of the software development lifecycle. However, case studies indicate that existing process models for HCD are not prepared to cope with the organizational obstacles typically encountered during the introduction and establishment of HCD methods in industrial software development organizations. Knowledge about exactly how to most efficiently and smoothly integrate HCD methods into development processes practiced by software development organizations is still not available. To bridge this gap, we present the experience-based human-centered design lifecycle, an interdisciplinary effort of experts in the fields of software engineering, human-computer interaction, and process improvement. Our approach aims at supporting the introduction, establishment and continuous improvement of HCD processes in software development organizations. The approach comprises a process model, tools, and organizational measures that promote the utilization of HCD methods in otherwise technology-centered development processes and facilitate organizational learning in HCD. We present results of a case study where our approach has been successfully applied in a major industrial software development project.},

  Abstract                 = {In 1993, the last {AAN} Practice Parameter on medical treatment of Parkinson's disease ({PD)} concluded that levodopa was the most effective drug for management of this disorder. Since then, a number of new compounds including non-ergot dopamine agonists ({DA)} and sustained-release levodopa have been released and studied. Thus, the issue of treatment in de novo {PD} patients warrants reexamination. Specific questions include: 1) does selegiline offer neuroprotection; 2) what is the best agent with which to initiate symptomatic treatment in de novo {PD;} and 3) is there a benefit of sustained release levodopa over immediate-release levodopa? Using evidence-based principles, a literature review using {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, and the Cochrane Library was performed to identify all human trials in de novo {PD} between 1966 and 1999. Only articles that fulfilled class I or class {II} evidence were included. Based on this review, the authors conclude: 1) Selegiline has very mild symptomatic benefit (level A, class {II} evidence) with no evidence for neuroprotective benefit (level U, class {II} evidence). 2) For {PD} patients requiring initiation of symptomatic therapy, either levodopa or a {DA} can be used (level A, class I and class {II} evidence). Levodopa provides superior motor benefit but is associated with a higher risk of dyskinesia. 3) No evidence was found that initiating treatment with sustained-release levodopa provides an advantage over immediate-release levodopa (level B, class {II} evidence).},

  Abstract                 = {{OBJECTIVES—To} measure the rate of progression in striatal [{18F]dopa} metabolism in a large group (n=32) of patients with Parkinson's disease, to estimate the average duration of preclinical period, and to examine the influence of the {PET} method on the assessment of rate of progression and preclinical period. {METHODS—Thirty} two patients with Parkinson's disease (mean age 58 ({SD} 13) years, mean duration 39 ({SD} 33) months) were assessed with [{18F]dopa} {PET} and {UPDRS} scoring on two occasions a mean of 18 ({SD} 6) months apart. {PET} data were sampled with separate caudate and putamen and total striatal regions of interest, and both graphical (Ki) and ratio methods of analysis. {RESULTS—The} mean annual rate of deterioration in [{18F]dopa} uptake varied according to structure and method of analysis, with putamen Ki showing the most rapid mean rate of progression (4.7\% of normal mean per year). The group showed a significant deterioration (p{\textless}0.0004, paired two tailed t test) in {UPDRS} and in the putamen (p=0.008) and total striatal (p=0.012) [{18F]dopa} uptake measured using a graphical analysis, but no significant change in caudate or putamen uptake measured by a ratio approach. A study of sensitivity confirmed that putamen Ki was the most sensitive measure of disease progression, caudate ratio the least. Symptom onset in Parkinson's disease was estimated at a mean putamen [{18F]dopa} uptake (Ki) of 75\% of normal and a mean caudate [{18F]dopa} uptake (Ki) of 91\% of normal. {CONCLUSIONS—Estimation} of mean rate of progression varies according to the sensitivity of a functional imaging method to clinical severity. Sensitivity and reproducibility of method must be considered when designing studies of disease progression and neuroprotection. The mean preclinical period in Parkinson's disease is unlikely to be longer than seven years.},

  Abstract                 = {Exergaming is expanding as an option for sedentary behavior in childhood/adult obesity and for extra exercise for gamers. This paper presents the development process for a mobile active sports exergame with near-realistic motions through the usage of body-wearable sensors. The process begins by collecting a dataset specifically targeted to mapping real-world activities directly to the games, then, developing the recognition system in a fashion to produce an enjoyable game. The classification algorithm in this paper has precision and recall of 77% and 77% respectively, compared with 40% and 19% precision and recall on current activity monitoring algorithms intended for general daily living activities. Aside from classification, the user experience must be strong enough to be a successful system for adoption. Indeed, fast and intense activities as well as competitive, multiplayer environments make for a successful, enjoyable exergame. This enjoyment is evaluated through a 30 person user study. Multiple aspects of the exergaming user experience trials have been merged into a comprehensive survey, called ExerSurvey. All but one user thought the motions in the game were realistic and difficult to cheat. Ultimately, a game with near-realistic motions was shown to be an enjoyable, active video exergame for any environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Detection of gait characteristics has found considerable interest in fields of biomechanics and rehabilitation sciences. In this paper an approach for abnormal gait detection employing discrete Fourier transform (DFT) analysis has been presented. The joint angle characteristics in frequency domain have been analyzed and using the harmonic coefficients, recognition for abnormal gait has been performed. The experimental results and analysis represent that the proposed algorithm based on DFT can not only reduce the gait data dimensionality effectively, but also lightens the computation cost, with a satisfactory distinction. In order to make the algorithm more generic, a mean square error (MSE) analysis is also presented. Future work will be the expansion of the detection introduced in this system to include abnormality detection instead of just an abnormal or normal detection that would prove to be a valuable addition for use in a variety of applications, including unobtrusive clinical gait analysis, automated surveillance etc.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Clinical distinction between advanced essential tremor and tremulous Parkinson's disease can be difficult. METHODS: In selected power spectra of accelerometric postural tremor recordings on the more affected side of 41 patients with essential tremor and 39 patients with tremulous Parkinson's disease being indistinguishable by tremor frequency, peak power or number of harmonic peaks, waveform asymmetry (autocorrelation decay), and mean peak power of all harmonic peaks were computed. Cutoff for essential tremor-Parkinson's disease distinction was determined by receiver operating characteristics. Diagnostic yield was tested in 12 clinically unclear patients with monosymptomatic tremor, subsequently definitively diagnosed with essential tremor (n = 2) or Parkinson's disease (n = 10) by 123-I FP-CIT-single-photon emission computed tomography, fluorodopa-positron emission tomography, or clinical course. RESULTS: By autocorrelation decay 64%, by mean harmonic peak power 94% (Parkinson's disease > essential tremor) of patients with a definite clinical diagnosis, and 11 of 12 clinically unclear patients were classified correctly. CONCLUSIONS: Mean harmonic power is a useful measure to separate clinically difficult cases of advanced essential tremor from tremulous Parkinson's disease. © 2011 Movement Disorder Society. },

  Abstract                 = {The emergence of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in healthcare applications is gaining momentum through the increasing array of wearable vital sign sensors and location tags which can track both healthcare personnel and patient status/ location continuously in real-time mode. Despite the increased range of potential application frameworks — ranging from pre-hospital, in-hospital, ambulatory and home monitoring, to long-term database collection for longitudinal trend analysis — the security gap between existing WSN designs and the requirements of medical applications remains unresolved. Generally, WSN devices are extremely limited in terms of power, computation, and communication. They are often deployed in accessible areas, thus increasing security vulnerabilities. The dynamic ad hoc topology, multicast transmission, location awareness, critical data prioritisation, and co-ordination of diverse sensors of healthcare applications further exacerbate the security challenges. This paper presents an analysis of various WSN security mechanisms from the demanding perspective of healthcare applications, and considers the importance of security to the successful deployment of pervasive computing solutions in the healthcare industry.},

O SOS constrói uma Rede Overlay (RO) sobre uma Rede de Sensor Sem Fio (RSSF).Ao estabelecer e monitorar rotas alternativas, o SOS e capaz de encontrar rotas mais seguras que as fornecidas pelo protocolo de roteamento padr ̃ o. Os resultados indicam que o SOS e: 1) eficaz no aumento da taxa de entrega de mensagens em redes sob ataques de negacao de servico e 2) eficiente em termos de consumo de energia. At ́ onde sabemos, o SOS e o primeiro mecanismo de seguranca baseado em ROs para RSSFs.},

  Review                   = {Redes overlay (ROs) s ̃ o redes constru ́das sobre redes f ́sicas convencionais, cuja funcao e migrar parte da complexidade de roteamento para a camada de aplicacao [Andersen et al. 2001]. Baseadas em um dado crit ́ rio, ROs s ̃ o capazes de monitorar a rede e fornecer caminhos alternativos ao usu ́ rio. Tais caminhos s ̃ o constru ́dos atrav ́ s da atuacao de nós overlay como intermediários no envio de dados. Como qualquer outro tipo de rede ad hoc sem fio, RSSFs s ̃ o vulner ́ veis a ataques [Karlof and Wagner 2003, Wood and Stankovic 2002]. Por ́ m, al ́ m das vulnerabili dades já existentes na comunicacao sem fio de redes ad hoc em geral, RSSFs enfrentam problemas adicionais. Elas comumente s ̃ o dispostas em ambientes abertos, muitas vezes O objetivo deste trabalho e avaliar o emprego de ROs para aumentar a seguranca de RSSFs hier ́ rquicas e heterogˆ neas. Mais detalhadamente, ao empregar redes ROs sobre RSSFs, esperamos aumentar a taxa de entrega de mensagens contendo informacao sensível a ERB em ambientes sob ataques de negacao de servico (Denial of Service –DoS). Trabalhos Relacionados -------------------------------------- Propostas de roteamento seguro para redes ad hoc em geral ( [Zhou and Haas 1999, Pa- padimitratos and Haas 2002, Capkun and Hubaux 2003], por exemplo) n ̃ o s ̃ o adequa-a a das para RSSFs, pois ou contam com criptografia de chave p ́ blica, ou n ̃ o levam em consideracao o roteamento assim ́ trico de “muitos pra um” de uma RSSF. Staaddon et al., por exemplo, propuseram um algoritmo eficiente para identificar n ́ s que falharam [Staddon et al. 2002] e desviar a informacao para rotas alternativas. Algumas das id ́ ias do trabalho, como a descoberta da vizinhanca por n ́ s e o envio desta e o informacao a ERB, foram tamb ́ m empregadas pelo SOS. J ́ Perrig et al. [Perrig et al. 2002] apresentaram SPINS, um conjunto de protocolos baseados em chaves sim ́ tricas para fornecer primitivas de seguranca (sigilo, autenticacao, integridade etc.) durante o roteamento. Há também trabalhos exclusivamente voltados para RSSFs hier ́ rquicas. Ambos os trabalhos de Kong et al. [Kong et al. 2002] e de Bohge e Trappe [Bohge and Trappe 2003] apresentam solucoes para redes hier ́ rquicas e heterogˆ neas. Contudo, eles presumem n ́ s muito poderosos, capazes de executar algoritmos de chave p ́ blica. Já SecLEACH emprega chaves aleat ́ rias para configurar e a operar a rede de forma autenticada e sigilosa 4. Modelo de Rede ------------------------------- Neste trabalho consideramos redes hier ́ rquicas e heterogˆ neas em que os n ́ s s ̃ o est ́ ticos. ́ A comunicacao funciona da seguinte forma. Entre filhos e CHs e single-hop, ȩ ̃ entre CHs em direcao a ERB multi-hop – ou seja, de CHs para CHs at ́ que se alcance a ERB. J ́ a ERB alcanca todos os n ́ s diretamente e a comunicacao ERB em direcao aos nós e single-hop. 5. SOS ---------0 O SOS constr ́ i uma RO sobre uma RSSF da seguinte forma. Alguns ou a totalidade do nós da RSSF subjacente s ̃ o escolhidos para integrar a RO. A cada um desses n ́ s, atribuída. Esses vizinhos, chamados de n ́ s overlay, uma lista de vizinhos l ́ gicos lhes e chamados de vizinhos overlay, s ̃ o usados como intermedi ́ rios em rotas alternativas a rota fornecida pelo protocolo padr ̃ o de roteamento (rota padr ̃ o). Os n ́ s overlay ent ̃ o alternam igualmente o envio de mensagens n ̃ o priorit ́ rias por essas rotas, incluindo a padrão.},

  Review                   = {Objetivo: This paper presents the results of a pilot study to assess the feasibility of using accelerometer data to estimate the severity of symptoms and motor complications in patients with Parkinson’s disease. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was implemented to estimate the severity of tremor, bradykinesia and dyskinesia from accelerometer data features. SVM-based estimates were compared with clinical scores derived via visual inspection of video recordings taken while patients performed a series of standardized motor tasks. O termo acinesia refere-se à redução da quantidade de movimento enquanto que bradicinesia significa lentidão na execução do movimento. O paciente apresenta redução da movimentação espontânea em todas as esferas. Introdução ----------------- PARKINSON’s disease affects about 3% of the population over the age of 65 years and more than 500,000 U.S. residents. The characteristic motor features of the disease include tremor, bradykinesia (i.e., slowness of movement), rigidity (i.e., resistance to externally imposed movements), and impaired postural balance. motivo da doença ----------------------------- The primary biochemical abnormality in Parkinson’s disease is a deficiency of dopamine due to degeneration of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Tratamento ------------------ Current therapy is based on augmentation or replacement of dopamine, using the biosynthetic precursor levodopa or drugs that activate dopamine receptors [1]. Problemas do Tratamento ----------------------------------------- These therapies are successful for some time, but most patients eventually develop motor complications [2]. Complications include wearing-off, the abrupt loss of efficacy at the end of each dosing interval, and dyskinesias, involuntary and, at times, violent writhing movements. Wearing-off and dysk- inesias produce substantial disability, and frequently interfere with medical therapies [3], [4]. Motivação da Aplicação ------------------------------------- Furthermore, variations in the severity of symptoms and motor complications (referred to as “motor fluctuations”) are observed during dosing intervals. Currently available tools for monitoring motor fluctuations are limited [5], [6]. In clinical practice, information about motor fluctuations is usually obtained by asking patients to recall the number of hours of ON (i.e., when medications effectively attenuate tremor) and OFF time (i.e., when medications are not effective). This kind of self-report is subject to perceptual bias (e.g., patients often have difficulty distinguishing dyskinesia from other symptoms) and recall bias. Another approach is the use of patient diaries, which can improve reliability by recording symptoms as they occur, but does not capture many of the features useful in clinical decision making [7]. Despite recent advances in wearable technology [17] and the development of software that optimizes the use of resources in body sensor networks [18], [19], the use of low-power radios based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard that has been adopted for implementing the majority of the available body sensor networks is still marked by excessive power consumption thus preventing long-term monitoring of patients unless one implements ad hoc strategies. To decrease power consumption requirements, our research team and others have pursued solutions that minimize the amount of information to be transferred wirelessly from the nodes to the base station of the monitoring system. This goal can be met by extracting (on the body sensor network nodes) and wirelessly transmitting features estimated from the raw data, instead of transmitting the raw data itself. Uma limitação dos trabalhos anteriores foi a dificuldade de desenvolver um sistema para monitorar os pacientes com parkinson integrando os algoritmos propostas para estimar a severidade e complicações dos sintomas motores de parkinson com a computação vestível. Outra limitação dos trabalhos anteriores foi o foco em sintomas únicos como trmores ou uma complicação motoro dyskinesia. O gerenciamento clínico da doença de parkinson requer uma complexa interação com os medicamentos dos múltimpos sintomas, motores e as as complicações monitoradas ao longo do tempo, avaliadas e integradas em algoritimos de gerênciamento clínico desses pacientes. COLETA DE DADOS =========== Doze indivíduos foram recrutados e estudados com idades entre 46 a 75 anos, diagnosticados com doença de Parkinson idiopática. Os sujeitdos ingerem seu primeiro medicamento pela manhã quando eles fazem e testam definindo como estado "OFF". Essa abordagem é usado para observar o paciente durante os sintomas motores mais severos. Os sujeitos são instruídos para avaliar o padrão das tarefas motoras utilizados clinicamente para avaliar os pacientes com doença de parkinson. These motor tasks are part of the motor section of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale ~\cite{updrs} and included finger-to-nose (reaching and touching a target), finger tapping, repeated hand movements (opening and closing both hands), heel tapping, quiet sitting, and alternating hand movements (repeated pronation/supination movements of the forearms). Fig. 1 shows pictures taken during the execution of these tasks. After completion of the baseline trial, subjects took their medications and were then tested using the same procedure every 30 min. Data was collected during seven trials performed at intervalsof 30 min. Video recordings were made during each trial so that a clinical evaluation of the severity of tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia could be performed later on. A clinical expert examined the video recordings and provided clinical scores representing the severity of tremor, dyskinesia, and bradykinesia for each motor task performed by patients during each trial. Such assessment relied upon the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale [20], which provides five discrete levels of severity ranging from 0 to 4. Clinical scores provided by clinicians via visual examination of the video recordings were compared with estimates derived from the accelerometer data using the methods described in the following sections.

  Abstract                 = {{ The aim of this review paper is to summarize recent developments in the field of wearable sensors and systems that are relevant to the field of rehabilitation. The growing body of work focused on the application of wearable technology to monitor older adults and subjects with chronic conditions in the home and community settings justifies the emphasis of this review paper on summarizing clinical applications of wearable technology currently undergoing assessment rather than describing the development of new wearable sensors and systems. A short description of key enabling technologies (i.e. sensor technology, communication technology, and data analysis techniques) that have allowed researchers to implement wearable systems is followed by a detailed description of major areas of application of wearable technology. Applications described in this review paper include those that focus on health and wellness, safety, home rehabilitation, assessment of treatment efficacy, and early detection of disorders. The integration of wearable and ambient sensors is discussed in the context of achieving home monitoring of older adults and subjects with chronic conditions. Future work required to advance the field toward clinical deployment of wearable sensors and systems is discussed. }},

  Abstract                 = {Extended communication and advanced cooperation in a permanently growing healthcare and welfare domain require a well-defined set of security services provided by an interoperable security infrastructure based on international and European standards. Any communication and collaboration procedure requires a purpose. But such legal purpose-binding is definitely not the only aspect to carefully be observed and investigated. More and more, aspects of security, safety, privacy, ethics, and quality reach importance while discussing about future-proof health information systems and health networks – regardless whether local, regional or even pan-European networks. During the course of the current paradigm change from an organization-centered to a process-related and to a person centered health system, different new technologies including mobile solutions need to be applied in order to meet challenges arising from both legal and technical circumstances. Beside the typical Information and Communication Technology systems and applications, the extended use of modern technologies includes large medical devices like, e.g., MRI and CT but also small devices like sensors worn by a person or included in clothing. Security and safety are on top of the priority list. The paper addresses the identification of some specific aspects like mobile technology and safety when moving both IT and people towards mobile health aiming at increasing citizens and patients awareness, confidence, and acceptance in future mobile care - a world often still beyond the horizon.},

  Review                   = {The paper addresses the identification of some specific aspects like mobile technology and safety when moving both IT and people towards mobile health aiming at increasing citizens and patients awareness, confidence, and acceptance in future mobile care - a world often still beyond the horizon. Advanced information and communication technology (ICT) solutions are an important pre-requisite for establishing today’s integrated care solutions. Disease management programs (DMP), public health and surveillance systems, and personal care settings are other aspects to be addressed in this context. 2.3. Applied Security Requirements Secure and reliable communication in a mobile world has applied security require- ments coming from different viewpoints. The first one is the “traditional” security domain. Mobile communications address both communication and application security services. 2.4. Technical Security Approaches Mobile communication requires the same -or at least a similar- level of security as ordinary communication using typical infrastructures like LAN or MAN. Thus, mobile security solutions can be based on well-known and well-established symmetric (DES, 3DES, IDEA, AES) and asymmetric (RSA) cryptographic algorithms as well as key traditional exchange protocols, e.g., following the Diffie-Hellman approach [8]. 3. RFID and NFC as a new Chance and Challenge Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) and Near Field Communication (NFC) are technical solutions to be applied in healthcare and welfare. Information systems com- bine ordinary information services with the use of RFID for identifying either goods (drugs, tools, tissues, samples) or even persons (health professionals, patients). Data is exchanged between passive RFID tag and readers in a few centimeters range. The ubiquitous presence of electromagnetic fields (EMF) is often expected to cause effects of electric or thermic nature to biological systems. In reality, RFID-related EMF values have a considerably low influence on humans. Side effect, however, can appear and shall specifically be considered when pace makers, brain stimulators or other implants are applied.},

  Abstract                 = {Communication and co-operation processes in the healthcare and welfare domain require a security infrastructure based on services describing status and relation of communicating principals as well as corresponding keys and attributes. Additional services provide trustworthy information on dynamic issues of communication and co-operation such as time and location of processes, workflow relations, integrity of archives and record systems, and system behaviour. To provide this communication and co-operation in a shared care environment, smart cards are widely used. Serving as storage media and portable application systems, patient data cards enable patient-controlled exchange and use of personal health data bound to specific purposes such as prescription and disease management. Additionally, patient status data such as the emergency data set or immunization may be stored in, and communicated by, patient data cards. Another deployment field of smart cards is their token functionality within a security framework, supporting basic security services such as identification, authentication, integrity, confidentiality, or accountability using cryptographic algorithms. In that context, keys, certificates, and card holder's attributes might be stored in the card as well. As an example, the German activity of introducing patient health cards and health professional cards is presented. Specification and enrolment aspects are on-going processes.},

Trata-se de um ensaio clínico cego e randomizado realizado na Associação Brasil Parkinson e no Centro de Docência e Pesquisa dos Cursos de Fonoaudiologia, Fisioterapia e Terapia Ocupacional da Universidade de São Paulo. Participaram do estudo 32 pacientes com doença de Parkinson nos estágios 1 a 2,5 da escala Hoehn e Yahr. Os pacientes foram randomizados nos grupos controle e experimental, 16 em cada grupo. Ambos os grupos realizaram 14 sessões individuais de treinamento, duas vezes por semana, por sete semanas. Cada sessão foi composta por 30 minutos de exercícios globais, incluindo alongamento e fortalecimento musculares e mobilidade axial. Logo após, ambos os grupos realizaram mais 30 minutos de treinamento de equilíbrio: o treinamento do grupo controle foi realizado por meio de exercícios de equilíbrio sem a utilização de pistas externas, retroalimentação visual ou auditiva ou estimulação cognitiva associada; o grupo experimental realizou o treinamento de equilíbrio por meio de 10 jogos do Nintendo Wii Fit, os quais estimularam as funções motoras e cognitivas. As principais medidas do estudo foram (1) seção {II} da Escala Unificada da Doença de Parkinson, ({UPDRS);} (2) Escala de Equilíbrio de Berg ({EEB);} (3) Unipedal Stance Test ({UST)} e (4) Montreal Cognitive Assessment ({MoCA).} A análise estatística foi realizada por meio da {ANOVA} de medidas repetidas e o pós hoc teste de Tukey para a verificação de possíveis diferenças entre os grupos e avaliações realizadas antes, depois e após 60 dias do final do treinamento. Ambos os grupos apresentaram melhora na seção {II} da {UPDRS}, na {EEB}, no {UST} e na {MoCA.} Conclui-se que os pacientes com doença de Parkinson apresentaram melhora no equilíbrio e na cognição com efeitos positivos sobre a funcionalidade relacionada com as atividades de vida diária após 14 sessões de treinamento de equilíbrio sem vantagens adicionais para o treinamento em ambiente virtual},

  Abstract                 = {Context Video games represent a multibillion-dollar industry in the U.S. Although video gaming has been associated with many negative health consequences, it also may be useful for therapeutic purposes. The goal of this study was to determine whether video games may be useful in improving health outcomes. Evidence acquisition Literature searches were performed in February 2010 in six databases: the Center on Media and Child Health Database of Research, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Reference lists were hand-searched to identify additional studies. Only \{RCTs\} that tested the effect of video games on a positive, clinically relevant health consequence were included. Study selection criteria were strictly defined and applied by two researchers working independently. Study background information (e.g., location, funding source); sample data (e.g., number of study participants, demographics); intervention and control details; outcomes data; and quality measures were abstracted independently by two researchers. Evidence synthesis Of 1452 articles retrieved using the current search strategy, 38 met all criteria for inclusion. Eligible studies used video games to provide physical therapy, psychological therapy, improved disease self-management, health education, distraction from discomfort, increased physical activity, and skills training for clinicians. Among the 38 studies, a total of 195 health outcomes were examined. Video games improved 69% of psychological therapy outcomes, 59% of physical therapy outcomes, 50% of physical activity outcomes, 46% of clinician skills outcomes, 42% of health education outcomes, 42% of pain distraction outcomes, and 37% of disease self-management outcomes. Study quality was generally poor; for example, two thirds (66%) of studies had follow-up periods of &lt;12 weeks, and only 11% of studies blinded researchers. Conclusions There is potential promise for video games to improve health outcomes, particularly in the areas of psychological therapy and physical therapy. \{RCTs\} with appropriate rigor will help build evidence in this emerging area.},

The kinematic data is obtained from some clinically suggested therapy modules that are used to monitor quality of improvement of a disabled child, which includes exercises involving the affected joints and muscles. The proposed environment uses the 3D depth sensing Microsoft Kinect device to detect, recognize and track the movement of different key joints of the body and deduce kinematic data from these movements. The method is non-invasive as the child does not need to wear any external devices in the body. The proposed environment incorporates Second Life serious game environment where the live therapeutic movement of child, therapist and one's community of interest is synchronized between physical and virtual world. Finally, we share our preliminary test data, which is validated by the therapists from three different disability hospitals that treat children with Hemiplegia.},

  Abstract                 = {Patient monitoring provides flexible and powerful patient surveillance through wearable devices at any time and anywhere. The increasing feasibility and convenience of mobile healthcare has already introduced several significant challenges for healthcare providers, policy makers, hospitals, and patients. A major challenge is to provide round-the-clock healthcare services to those patients who require it via wearable wireless medical devices. Furthermore, many patients have privacy concerns when it comes to releasing their personal information over open wireless channels. As a consequence, one of the most important and challenging issues that healthcare providers must deal with is how to secure the personal information of patients and to eliminate their privacy concerns. In this article we present several techniques that can be used to monitor patients effectively and enhance the functionality of telemedicine systems, and discuss how current secure strategies can impede the attacks faced by wireless communications in healthcare systems and improve the security of mobile healthcare.},

  Abstract                 = {Many healthcare technology projects fail due to the lack of consideration of human issues, such as workflow, organizational change, and usability, during the design and implementation stages of a project's development process. Even when human issues are considered, the consideration is typically on designing better user interfaces. We argue that human-centered computing goes beyond a better user interface: it should include considerations of users, functions and tasks that are fundamental to human-centered computing. From this perspective, we integrated a previously developed human-centered methodology with a Project Design Life-cycle, and we applied this integration in the design of a complex distributed knowledge management system for the Biomedical Engineer (BME) domain in the Mission Control Center at NASA Johnson Space Center. We analyzed this complex system, identified its problems, generated systems requirements, and provided specifications of a replacement prototype for effective organizational memory and knowledge management. We demonstrated the value provided by our human-centered approach and described the unique properties, structures, and processes discovered using this methodology and how they contributed in the design of the prototype.},

  Abstract                 = {This multicentre randomised double-blind 3- to 5-year trial was designed to assess whether initial therapy with cabergoline alone or in combination with levodopa prevents or delays the occurrence of long term motor complications in patients with early Parkinson's disease. Patients eligible for study inclusion (n = 412) had early idiopathic Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr stages 1 to 3) and had received no previous treatment with levodopa, selegiline or dopamine agonists. Patients were randomised to receive either cabergoline (0.25 to 4 mg once daily) or levodopa (100 to 600 mg/day) titrated over a maximum period of 24 weeks. Once the optimum or maximum tolerated dose was achieved, it was maintained up to the end-point (development of motor complications confirmed at 2 consecutive 3-month visits) or up to a minimum of 3 years' treatment. Open labelled levodopa was added in both treatment arms when the improvement in motor disability [Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale ({UPDRS)} factor {III]} decreased below 30\% vs baseline. Both treatments improved motor disability, decreasing {UPDRS} factor {III} scores and factor {II} scores for activities of daily living. The development of motor complications (end-point) was significantly less frequent in patients treated with cabergoline than in levodopa recipients (22\% vs 34\%; p {\textless} 0.02). The relative risk of developing motor complications during treatment with cabergoline was more than 50\% lower than with levodopa. Serious adverse events, either drug related or not, were slightly more frequent in cabergoline-treated patients (31\%) than in those treated with levodopa (25\%). The withdrawal rate in the cabergoline vs levodopa group was 16 vs 13\%. In conclusion, the study shows that, in patients with early Parkinson's disease, cabergoline is effective either as monotherapy or combined with levodopa. Moreover, starting treatment with cabergoline significantly delays the development of motor complications.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A new paradigm for medical care is emerging which terms itself “personalized medicine”. Advocates claim that medical treatment can now be targeted on the specific characteristics of each individual, using genetic profiling to identify the particular nature of the condition, and to tailor treatments for each person. Further, they argue, the focus of medicine will move from treatment to prevention. It is claimed that genetic tests based on recent genomic research will enable doctors to identify susceptibilities for such common conditions before the onset of illness, and to target preventive intervention to reduce the individual and social burdens of ill health. Further, it is argued that genetic information will allow precision in the choice of drugs and doses, avoiding adverse reactions, minimising waste, reducing costs and increasing efficacy. Coupled with other advances, it is argued that the future of medicine should and will be “personalised, predictive and preventive.” Drawing on such developments, we have seen the growth of personal genomics companies marketing tests “direct to consumers” that claim to identify individual disease susceptibilities and to “empower” individuals by giving them the information—and the personal responsibility—to manage their own health. This paper critically assesses the promises made for personalized medicine, discusses some of the challenges for health policy, and considers the social and ethical implications of moving medical care towards such a personalized and individualized model. },

Pervasive healthcare systems are applications that can support patient’s need anytime and anywhere. However, pervasive healthcare raises privacy concerns since it can lead to situations where patients may not be aware that their private information is being shared and becomes vulnerable to threat. We have systematically analyzed the privacy issues and present a summary in tabular form to show the relationship among the issues. The six issues identified are medical information misuse, prescription leakage, medical information eavesdropping, social implications for the patient, patient difficulties in managing privacy settings, and lack of support in designing privacy-sensitive applications. We narrow down he issues and chose to focus on the issue of ‘lack of support in designing privacy- sensitive applications’ by proposing a privacy-sensitive architecture specifically designed for pervasive healthcare monitoring systems.},

  Review                   = {Privacy issues commonly discussed among researchers, practitioners, and end-users in pervasive healthcare. This means, for instance, that a patient with heart problems can stay in the comfort of their own home while being monitored by healthcare services, instead of staying at the hospital. that there is a need to address privacy in a pervasive healthcare system. Privacy law generally defines an individual’s privacy as personal information about an individual that can represent that individual as a whole, which consequently describes an individual. To protect their privacy, patients have the right to give permission as to which data should be collected, used or disclosed [2]. Motivations ------------------ 1. many privacy issues and challenges arise; for that reason, we would like to understand the current issues and challenges. We selected published research papers that relate to ubiquitous computing, pervasive healthcare in general and pervasive healthcare monitoring systems. In 2006 and 2007 there are at least ten published research papers each year. The number of papers published related to these issues increased since 2006 compared to the years 2000 to 2005. This shows that the number of researchers that are interested in this field is increasing. Furthermore this shows that security and privacy issues are important to ensuring the success of pervasive healthcare development and implementation. Healthcare Monitoring System ----------------------------------------------- to ensure help issent immediately in case of emergency. The system can monitor a cancer patient’s progress from home after treatment or it can monitor a schizophrenic patient’s behavior at a psychiatric ward. This type of monitoring is important to ensure a patient’s treatment is accurately recorded hence making it easier for healthcare professionals to provide follow up treatment. If the patient has a problem in future, all the stored data can be easily accessed to speed up the treatment decision. The signal is sent from the device to healthcare providers via Bluetooth connection. If any unusual vital signs are detected, help is immediately sent. The wireless connection could open more privacy issues as it has the potential security flaw of permitting unauthorized persons to steal the data hence intruding patient’s privacy data. To protect the patient’s privacy, the system should have strong privacy data management controls to lessen the privacy risk. There are three main stakeholders that have privacy concerns in a healthcare monitoring system: the patient, the family and the healthcare providers. The system is also connected to the mother’s healthcare providers but they are not allowed to watch the video except in case of emergency. In order to protect the patient’s data privacy, the healthcare provider also does not have any access to the patient’s information unless there is an emergency. Privacy Issues --------------------- Privacy issues derive from multidisciplinary fields such as computer science, bioinformatics, the social sciences and medical science. and researchers are also starting to raise privacy issues. For example, before dementia patients agree to use the application, they and their relatives often ask about the privacy policies. This is because they want to ensure that their use either health is taken care of by the healthcare service providers while the privacy of their life is insured. The six issues identified are medical information misuse, prescription leakage, medical information eavesdropping, social implications for the patient, patient difficulties in managing privacy settings, and lack of support in designing privacy-sensitive applications. A. Misuse of Patient Medical Information by Unauthorized Individual B. Prescription Leakage C. Eavesdropping of Patient’s Medical Information D. Social Implications for the Patients E. Difficulties in Managing Privacy Policies F. Lack of Support in Designing Privacy Sensitive Applications Trabalho Proposto ----------------------------- We have analyzed the privacy issues in ubiquitous computing in general and pervasive healthcare monitoring systems in particular in the previous section. In this section, we propose privacy architecture to enable the development of pervasive healthcare monitoring systems with a better privacy setting. They mention that they want to address issues about patients’ private information leakage by building a healthcare framework that will provide intelligent medical data acquisition. However, it does not mention how patients can manage their privacy settings on their own.},

  Abstract                 = {A Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is a collection of low-power and lightweight wireless sensor nodes that are used to monitor the human body functions and the surrounding environment. It supports a number of innovative and interesting applications, including ubiquitous healthcare and Consumer Electronics (CE) applications. Since WBAN nodes are used to collect sensitive (life-critical) information and may operate in hostile environments, they require strict security mechanisms to prevent malicious interaction with the system. In this paper, we first highlight major security requirements and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in WBAN at Physical, Medium Access Control (MAC), Network, and Transport layers. Then we discuss the IEEE 802.15.4 security framework and identify the security vulnerabilities and major attacks in the context of WBAN. Different types of attacks on the Contention Access Period (CAP) and Contention Free Period (CFP) parts of the superframe are analyzed and discussed. It is observed that a smart attacker can successfully corrupt an increasing number of GTS slots in the CFP period and can considerably affect the Quality of Service (QoS) in WBAN (since most of the data is carried in CFP period). As we increase the number of smart attackers the corrupted GTS slots are eventually increased, which prevents the legitimate nodes to utilize the bandwidth efficiently. This means that the direct adaptation of IEEE 802.15.4 security framework for WBAN is not totally secure for certain WBAN applications. New solutions are required to integrate high level security in WBAN.},

  Abstract                 = {The main problem in pervasive healthcare monitoring systems is protection of patient privacy without compromising their safety. Current solutions have two main limitations: (1) they require an extensive exchange of messages among patient's caregivers and devices in order to protect data, and (2) they depend on using data decryption keys that must be provided to specific caregivers. The second limitation compromises safety of patients who need urgent help while their ad hoc caregivers have no access to their health data (since they have no needed decryption keys). This paper proposes an approach for protecting privacy of patients based on active bundles. An active bundle encapsulates sensitive data, metadata, and a virtual machine. In healthcare monitoring systems, "sensitive data" are monitored health data. To avoid compromising of safety of patients who need urgent help, our approach does not depend on the use of decryption keys provided to specific caregivers (which is a commonly used approach). Instead, it combines the use of privacy policies and protection mechanisms included within active bundles, such as evaporation and apoptosis. In our approach, ad hoc caregivers are able to access urgently needed patients' data. Their authorizations are provided via privacy policies encapsulated in metadata of an active bundle including health data.},

  Abstract                 = {Overweight and obesity has doubled among children in Australia. There is an urgent need to develop primary prevention strategies to prevent current and future unhealthy weight gain. The aims of this paper are to describe a randomized controlled trial ({‘Switch-Play’)} developed to prevent unhealthy weight gain among 10-year-old children and to report the findings of the process evaluation. Children from three government primary schools were randomized by class to one of four conditions: a behavioural modification group ({BM;} n = 69); a fundamental motor skills group ({FMS;} n = 73); a combined {BM} and {FMS} group (n = 90); or a control (usual classroom lessons) group (n = 61). Children in the {BM} group participated in 19 sessions that encouraged them to reduce screen-based behaviours, and identified physical activity alternatives. The {FMS} group participated in 19 lessons that focused on mastery of six skills: run, throw, dodge, strike, vertical jump and kick. The combined group participated in all the {BM} and {FMS} activities. The intervention specialist teacher reported that the children showed high enjoyment and engagement (88\% lessons attended) in most aspects of the programme. At-home tasks were completed by 57–62\% of the children, and 92\% completed the in-class tasks. Two-thirds of the children in the {BM} group participated in the behavioural contracting to switch off the {TV.} Most of the children reported high enjoyment of the programmes, and only a small proportion (7–17\%) reported difficulties in switching off their nominated {TV} shows. More than half the children reported reducing their {TV} viewing; however, less than half reported increasing their physical activity. It was found that most aspects of the intervention arms of the programme were successfully delivered to the majority of children participating in {‘Switch-Play’;} that the programmes were delivered as intended; and that the programmes were favourably evaluated by participating children and their parents.},

  Abstract                 = {Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that predominantly alter patients' motor performance and compromises the speed, the automaticity and fluidity of natural movements. The patients fluctuate between periods in which they can move almost normally for some hours (ON state) and periods with motor disorders (OFF state). Gait properties are affected by the motor state of a patient: reduced stride length, reduced gait speed, increased stride width etc. The ability to assess the motor states (ON/OFF) on a continuous basis for long time without disturbing the patients' daily life activities is an important component of PD management. An accurate report of motor states could allow clinics to adjust the medication regimen to avoid OFF periods. The real-time monitoring will also allow an online treatment by combining, for instance, with automatic drug-administration pump doses. Many studies have attempted to extract gait properties through a belt-worn single tri-axial accelerometer. In this paper, a user friendly position is proposed to place the accelerometer and three step detection methods and three step length estimators are compared considering the proposed sensor placement in signals obtained from healthy volunteers and PD patients. Adaptation methods to these step length estimators are also proposed and compared. The comparison shows that the adapted estimators improve the performance with the new proposed step detection method and reduce errors in respect of the original methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) are used in the ubiquitous healthcare to measure human body functions like vital physiological data (e.g. heart beat). As the privacy-sensitive sensor data are transferred over the unreliable wireless connection and can be shared among various BSN applications, it is necessary to protect this data against potential threats. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an approach to design a lightweight security model with respect to limited resource constraints of our special purpose sensor platform.},

  Review                   = {O projeto VITRUVIUS, pretende desenvolver uma plataforma de sensor para o corpo humano, que poassa ser aplicado a diversas redes BSN instaladas dinamicamente, pretendendo se conectar a sistemas de retaguarda de qualquer plataforma. Os dados capturados peos sensores devem ser trafegados por redes sem fio de acordo com os padrões de segurança estabelecidos sem alteração ou violação da autenticidade dos dados. Os requisitos de segurança de uma BSN são significativamente diferentes de uma rede sensor típica. Contrastando que numa rede sensor típica são medidos dados públicos como temperatura, humidade em uma rede BSN são coletados informação vitais humanas como o batimento cardíaco e a pressão sanguínea. In this paper we present system architecture and we outline potential threats to the BSN as part of the overall system. With respect to the threats, we define a set of security requirements and summarize related solutions proposed by state-of-the-art security protocols in the WSN. In this paper, we consider threats to the BSN with respect to the communication channel from sensors to body hub. The threats are instantiated by the attacks which are effective because of associated vulnerabilities (weaknesses) in the BSN. Foram examinados a ocorrência dos seguintes ataques e vulnerabilidades: 1-Wrong data from sensor : This might happen because of a faulty sensor, a noisy channel or malicious alteration of transmitted messages. 2-Data loss 3-Spoofing of sensor : Unintentionally or maliciously a sensor may be attached to a wrong person or a wrong sensor-body hub relationship may be established. Furthermore, the attacker may spoof the identity of the sensor. Our security method must make such spoofing impossible by using authentication. 4-Eavesdropping and replay: A malicious attacker might intercept messages for inspection or replay. Our security method, therefore, must encrypt messages and protect them against the replay III. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS A. Confidentiality. - Uso de criptografia B. Authenticity. - Armazenar o MacAddress + a criptografia C. Replay protection. - Contagem de mensagem e timestamp D. Tolerance to message loss. - O número de mensagem perdida pode ser realizada através de um contador},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate diagnosis and individualized assessment of the risks and benefits of available antiparkinsonian medications should guide initiation of treatment for patients with early Parkinson's disease ({PD).} In general, the goals of treatment for younger patients (less than age 60 years) are control of impairing symptoms, sparing of levodopa to minimize long-term complications, and consideration of neuroprotection. The primary initial medication choices for patients under age 50 years include selegiline, amantadine, and anticholinergic agents. Patients in their fifties may require a dopamine agonist in addition to or instead of selegiline to achieve adequate symptom control. If the desired response is still not achieved, sustained-release carbidopa-levodopa should be added, followed by adjunctive amantadine or anticholinergic therapy. For older patients (60 years and over), improvement of functional impairment is the primary goal. For these patients, a special concern is to avoid inducing or exacerbating cognitive impairment. Sustained-release carbidopa-levodopa is considered first-line treatment for these patients. Inadequate response can be handled by a trial of immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa and then addition of a dopamine agonist when maximum levodopa doses are reached. Anticholinergic agents, amantadine, and selegiline should be avoided because of their {CNS} effects.},

Clear goals (expectations and rules are discernible and goals are attainable and align appropriately with one’s skill set and abilities). 4. Unambiguous feedback (successes and failures in the course of the activity are apparent, so that behaviour can be adjusted as needed). 5. Concentrating and focusing, a high degree of concentration on a limited field of attention (a person engaged in the activity will have the opportunity to focus and to delve deeply into it). 6.

  Review                   = {Capturar a resposta dos dados fisiológicos é um fator importante para avaliar a eficácia do exergame. Por exemplo, para um exergame ser seguro e efetivo para exercícios aeróbicos, é recomendado atender às guidelines dos exercício físicos aeróbicos. Para remover a necessidade de testes físicos foi proposto um sistema de extração de dados virtuais. O jogador humano não provÊ as ações diretamente para o controlador do exergame mas sim um controlador de jogo padrão para jogar o exergame. A saída do controlador padrão é então passado para um controlador virtual que simula o dispositivo de controlo que seria normalmente usado. Como o jogador já não realiza a física actividades normalmente associadas com o jogo jogar, devemos substituir os biossensores que o jogo usos com um software que gera o sensor simulado de dados. A Figura 2 mostra um jogador emulador estado físico, que calcula o jogador é normalmente esperado estado com base no simulado do jogador ações físicas. Os biossensores virtuais, em seguida, usar estado físico do jogador para gerar o requerido dados de sensores simulados. Emulating the Player’s Physical State ============================= The physical exertion data generated by the gameplay moves to another part of the system to produce simulated physiological effects on a virtual body. The software developer needs this data to verify that any changes he or she made are on the correct track. The data can be used to make the system work with exergaming systems requiring biofeedback. For example, the software could calculate heart rate such that it can provide input into systems measuring heart rate. Ideally, the virtual body would also be able to respond to excessive exercise in the same manner that a player actually exercising would. =================== Esse trabalho lembra bastante o AVATAR que eu tinha pensado inicialmente que o avatar seria sensivel ao contexto},

  Review                   = {O estilo de vida atual com dispositivos eletrônicos, internet e demais componentes tecnológicos não privilegiam a atividade física, por esse motivo ocorre um decréscimo de indivíduos saudáveis e que privilegiem a saúde. Com o objetivo de alinhar o uso da tecnologia para motivar a execução de exercícios físicos, pesquisadores da área de jogos para saúde buscam apoiar a prática dessas atividades através de jogos para exercício físico como também tentam mudar a consciência dos usuários para uma vida mais saudável. Através dos dispostivos de sensores de movimento o uso de jogos se tornou uma forma promissora de promoção da saúde e bem-estar. O número de jogos comerciais bem como serviços de Internet móvel relacionados com a saúde e bem-estar tem crescido rapidamente nos últimos anos. Especialmente exergames, ou seja, jogos que combinam exercícios com jogos, ganharam aumento atenção por pesquisadores na promoção da atividade física e consequentemente, a saúde ~\cite{baran08}. Partindo da enfase na importancia social dos jogos, off-line e multiplayer. Foram catalogados as implicações de design para jogos que promovam a saúde. Exergames como DDR (Dance Dance Revolution), Wii Sports e Guitar Hero têm-se tornado extremamente populares e têm-se estudado seus benefícios ao aumentar a atividade física ~\ciote{baran08}. Posteriormente esses jogos estarão combinando educação, com exercício físico, com o foco de permitir que as pessoas se movam enquanto estão jogando. Esses jogos permitem também corrigir posturas, forçar o exercício físico, fornecer feedback e um guia de forma simples e não impactando no comportamento do jogador. Atualmente, vários jogos pervasivos móveis, motivam a atividade física de forma mais direta. Protótipo de jogos como Trranse e Feeding Yoshi, e diversos jogos móveis promovem a saúde como Noliaś Wellness Diary and Sports Tracker em versões beta. Para o autor, jogos que pretendem tratar a saúde devem ser: divertidos, imersivos e engajados. Um jogo para ser considerado sério, tem que privilegiar o seu propósito de educação, monitoramento ou acompanhamento ao invés da jogabilidade. Trabalhos Relacionados ------------------------------------- Para Massively Multiplayer Role-Playing Games (MMORPG), Yee [20] divide a motivação dos jogos on-line em três dimensões: realização, imersão e sociabilizadade. A realização consiste em atingir os objetivos, fazendo progresso de nível e ganhando poderes e de forma paralela competir com outros jogadores, assim como entender as regras e mecânica do jogo. Os subfatores de imersão são descoberta, RPG, customização e escapismo. Escapismo é sobre como usar o jogo ambiente como um lugar para relaxar, enquanto explora o mundo do jogo e suas localizações, informações e artefatos. O fator de sociabilidade é composto de socializar, conhecer e colaborar com outros jogadores. Também formando relações mais significativas com outras pessoas, lidar com questões da vida real e os problemas podem motivar os jogadores. Socializar com os outros também aumentando o nível de interação através de um jogo. [20] Métodos ------------- Foram coletados através de um web survey as tecnologias utilizadas para jogar. Havia 128 entrevistados na pesquisa da web, que foram para a setima e nona série de duas escolas grau completo. a maioria (125) dos respondentes eram 13-16 anos (média de 14,52, std. 1,04) e 72 (56%) dos entrevistados eram meninas e 56 (44%) meninos. A pesquisa web cobriu por exemplo, a frequência e tipo de tecnologia utilizada, bem como os hábitos de jogo, preferências, motivações e aspectos importantes no jogo, que foi medido por um de 5 pontos Escala de Likert ancorada em 1 (muito importante) e 5 (muito importante). Os resultados da pesquisa foram analisados ​​usando web métodos estatísticos de análise, tais como freqüências e distribuições. Quatro jogos relacionados com a saúde, dos quais dois foram jogos online, uma era um jogo para celular e um foi um exergame, foram selecionados para avaliações. Cada par jogado um jogo durante a avaliação sessão. As notas de entrevista e observação foram transcritas e foram analisadas com o método de análise de conteúdo. Segundo a pesquisa da Web, aspectos importantes no jogo, além de jogar na companhia de amigos, estavam progredindo em um jogo (muito importante: 36%), relaxante (muito importante: 35%) e sucesso (muito importante: 30%). Jogos muito importantes outros motivações foram modificando (25%) e de criação (23%) o papel personagens em um jogo, melhorar os resultados (20%) e habilidades (20%), explorar o mundo do jogo (20%), e interagindo com outros jogadores (21%).},

  Review                   = {O estilo de vida atual com dispositivos eletrônicos, internet e demais componentes tecnológicos não privilegiam a atividade física, por esse motivo ocorre um decréscimo de indivíduos saudáveis e que privilegiem a saúde. Com o objetivo de alinhar o uso da tecnologia para motivar a execução de exercícios físicos, pesquisadores da área de jogos para saúde buscam apoiar a prática dessas atividades através de jogos para exercício físico como também tentam mudar a consciência dos usuários para uma vida mais saudável. Através dos dispostivos de sensores de movimento o uso de jogos se tornou uma forma promissora de promoção da saúde e bem-estar. O número de jogos comerciais bem como serviços de Internet móvel relacionados com a saúde e bem-estar tem crescido rapidamente nos últimos anos. Especialmente exergames, ou seja, jogos que combinam exercícios com jogos, ganharam aumento atenção por pesquisadores na promoção da atividade física e consequentemente, a saúde ~\cite{baran08}. Partindo da enfase na importancia social dos jogos, off-line e multiplayer. Foram catalogados as implicações de design para jogos que promovam a saúde. Exergames como DDR (Dance Dance Revolution), Wii Sports e Guitar Hero têm-se tornado extremamente populares e têm-se estudado seus benefícios ao aumentar a atividade física ~\ciote{baran08}. Posteriormente esses jogos estarão combinando educação, com exercício físico, com o foco de permitir que as pessoas se movam enquanto estão jogando. Esses jogos permitem também corrigir posturas, forçar o exercício físico, fornecer feedback e um guia de forma simples e não impactando no comportamento do jogador. Atualmente, vários jogos pervasivos móveis, motivam a atividade física de forma mais direta. Protótipo de jogos como Trranse e Feeding Yoshi, e diversos jogos móveis promovem a saúde como Noliaś Wellness Diary and Sports Tracker em versões beta. Para o autor, jogos que pretendem tratar a saúde devem ser: divertidos, imersivos e engajados. Um jogo para ser considerado sério, tem que privilegiar o seu propósito de educação, monitoramento ou acompanhamento ao invés da jogabilidade. Trabalhos Relacionados ------------------------------------- Para Massively Multiplayer Role-Playing Games (MMORPG), Yee [20] divide a motivação dos jogos on-line em três dimensões: realização, imersão e sociabilizadade. A realização consiste em atingir os objetivos, fazendo progresso de nível e ganhando poderes e de forma paralela competir com outros jogadores, assim como entender as regras e mecânica do jogo. Os subfatores de imersão são descoberta, RPG, customização e escapismo. Escapismo é sobre como usar o jogo ambiente como um lugar para relaxar, enquanto explora o mundo do jogo e suas localizações, informações e artefatos. O fator de sociabilidade é composto de socializar, conhecer e colaborar com outros jogadores. Também formando relações mais significativas com outras pessoas, lidar com questões da vida real e os problemas podem motivar os jogadores. Socializar com os outros também aumentando o nível de interação através de um jogo. [20] Métodos ------------- Foram coletados através de um web survey as tecnologias utilizadas para jogar. Havia 128 entrevistados na pesquisa da web, que foram para a setima e nona série de duas escolas grau completo. a maioria (125) dos respondentes eram 13-16 anos (média de 14,52, std. 1,04) e 72 (56%) dos entrevistados eram meninas e 56 (44%) meninos. A pesquisa web cobriu por exemplo, a frequência e tipo de tecnologia utilizada, bem como os hábitos de jogo, preferências, motivações e aspectos importantes no jogo, que foi medido por um de 5 pontos Escala de Likert ancorada em 1 (muito importante) e 5 (muito importante). Os resultados da pesquisa foram analisados ​​usando web métodos estatísticos de análise, tais como freqüências e distribuições. Quatro jogos relacionados com a saúde, dos quais dois foram jogos online, uma era um jogo para celular e um foi um exergame, foram selecionados para avaliações. Cada par jogado um jogo durante a avaliação sessão. As notas de entrevista e observação foram transcritas e foram analisadas com o método de análise de conteúdo. Segundo a pesquisa da Web, aspectos importantes no jogo, além de jogar na companhia de amigos, estavam progredindo em um jogo (muito importante: 36%), relaxante (muito importante: 35%) e sucesso (muito importante: 30%). Jogos muito importantes outros motivações foram modificando (25%) e de criação (23%) o papel personagens em um jogo, melhorar os resultados (20%) e habilidades (20%), explorar o mundo do jogo (20%), e interagindo com outros jogadores (21%).},

  Abstract                 = {Although player enjoyment is central to computer games, there is currently no accepted model of player enjoyment in games. There are many heuristics in the literature, based on elements such as the game interface, mechanics, gameplay, and narrative. However, there is a need to integrate these heuristics into a validated model that can be used to design, evaluate, and understand enjoyment in games. We have drawn together the various heuristics into a concise model of enjoyment in games that is structured by flow. Flow, a widely accepted model of enjoyment, includes eight elements that, we found, encompass the various heuristics from the literature. Our new model, GameFlow, consists of eight elements -- concentration, challenge, skills, control, clear goals, feedback, immersion, and social interaction. Each element includes a set of criteria for achieving enjoyment in games. An initial investigation and validation of the GameFlow model was carried out by conducting expert reviews of two real-time strategy games, one high-rating and one low-rating, using the GameFlow criteria. The result was a deeper understanding of enjoyment in real-time strategy games and the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of the GameFlow model as an evaluation tool. The GameFlow criteria were able to successfully distinguish between the high-rated and low-rated games and identify why one succeeded and the other failed. We concluded that the GameFlow model can be used in its current form to review games; further work will provide tools for designing and evaluating enjoyment in games.},

Code artifacts are mapped to features, and a customized software system can be generated given a selection of features. The set of software systems that can be generated is called a software product line (SPL). FeatureIDE supports several \{FOSD\} implementation techniques such as feature-oriented programming, aspect-oriented programming, delta-oriented programming, and preprocessors. All phases of \{FOSD\} are supported in FeatureIDE, namely domain analysis, requirements analysis, domain implementation, and software generation. },

  Abstract                 = {The seamless integration of low-power, miniaturised, invasive/non-invasive lightweight sensor nodes have contributed to the development of a proactive and unobtrusive Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN). A WBAN provides long-term health monitoring of a patient without any constraint on his/her normal dailylife activities. This monitoring requires low-power operation of invasive/non-invasive sensor nodes. In other words, a power-efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is required to satisfy the stringent WBAN requirements including low-power consumption. In this paper, we first outline the WBAN requirements that are important for the design of a low-power MAC protocol. Then we study low-power MAC protocols proposed/investigated for WBAN with emphasis on their strengths and weaknesses. We also review different power-efficient mechanisms for WBAN. In addition, useful suggestions are given to help the MAC designers to develop a low-power MAC protocol that will satisfy the stringent WBAN requirements.},

Objetivos de uma WBAN Some of the common objectives in WBAN are to achieve maximum throughput, minimum delay, and to maximize the network lifetime by controlling the main sources of energy waste, i.e., collision, idle listening, overhearing, and control packet overhead. Responsabilidade de um MAC A minimal number of control packets should be used for data transmission. Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols play an important role in solving the aforementioned problems. Generally they are grouped into contention-based and schedule-based MAC protocols. In contention-based MAC protocols such as Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocols, nodes contend for the channel to transmit data. The development of a low-power MAC protocol for WBAN has been a hot research topic for the last few years. Considerable research efforts have been dedicated to propose/investigate new MAC protocols that could satisfy the crucial WBAN requirements. A number of researchers have considered IEEE 802.15.4 [1] for WBAN since it supports low data rate applications, but it is not enough to support high data rate applications (data rate > 250 Kbps). WBAN MAC REQUIREMENTS ================= 1. The most important attribute of a good MAC protocol for WBAN is energy efficiency. For example, cardiac defibrillators and pacemakers should have a lifetime of more than 5 years, while swallowable camera pills have a lifetime of 12 hours [6]. Power-efficient and flexible duty cycling techniques are required to minimize the idle listening, overhear- ing, packet collisions and control packet overhead problems. 2. The Quality of Service (QoS) is also an important factor of a good MAC protocol for WBAN. For emergency applications, the MAC protocol should allow in-body or on-body nodes to get quick access to the channel (in less than one second) and to send the emergency data to the coordinator. EXISTING / PROPOSED MAC PROTOCOLS FOR WBAN =============================== 1. IEEE 802.15.4 IEEE 802.15.4 is a low-power standard designed for low data rate applications. It offers three operational frequency bands: 868 MHz, 915 MHz, and 2.4 GHz bands. There are 27 sub-channels allocated in IEEE 802.15.4, i.e., 16 sub-channels in 2.4 GHz band, 10 sub-channels in 915 MHz band and one sub-channel in the 868 MHz band, as given in Some of the main reasons of selecting IEEE 802.15.4 for WBAN are low-power communication and support of low data rate WBAN applications. Nicolas et al. investigated the performance of a non-beacon IEEE 802.15.4 in [10], where low upload/download rates (mostly per hour) are considered. 2. Heartbeat Driven MAC (H-MAC) Protocol A Heartbeat Driven MAC protocol (H-MAC) is a TDMA-based protocol originally proposed for a star topology WBAN. The energy efficiency is improved by exploiting heartbeat rhythm information in order to synchronize the nodes. The nodes do not need to receive periodic information to perform synchronization. The heartbeat rhythm can be extracted from the sensory data and hence all the rhythms represented by peak sequences are naturally synchronized. The H-MAC protocol assigns dedicated time slots to each node to guarantee collision-free transmission. This protocol is supported by an active synchronization recovery scheme supported by two resynchronization schemes. For example, a blood pressure node may not need a dedicated time slot while an endoscope pill may require a number of dedicated time slots when deployed in WBAN. But the slots should be released when the endoscope pill is expelled. The heartbeat rhythm information varies depending on the patient condition. It may not reveal valid information for synchronization all the time. 3. A BodyMAC protocol is a TDMA-based protocol where the channel is bounded by TDMA superframe structures with downlink and uplink subframes as given in Fig. 4. The downlink frame is used to accommodate the on-demand traffic and the uplink frame is used to accom- modate the normal traffic. There is no proper mechanism to handle emergency traffic. The uplink frame is further divided into CAP and CFP periods. The CAP period is used to transmit small size MAC packets. The CFP period is used to transmit the normal data in a TDMA slot. The duration of the downlink and uplink superframes are defined by the coordinator.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of this study was to estimate the incidence of Parkinson’s disease by age, gender, and ethnicity. Newly diagnosed Parkinson’s disease cases in 1994–1995 were identified among members of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of Northern California, a large health maintenance organization. Each case met modified standardized criteria/Hughes diagnostic criteria as applied by a movement disorder specialist. Incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were calculated using the Kaiser Permanente membership information as the denominator and adjusted for age and/or gender using the direct method of standardization. A total of 588 newly diagnosed (incident) cases of Parkinson’s disease were identified, which gave an overall annualized age- and gender-adjusted incidence rate of 13.4 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval (CI): 11.4, 15.5). The incidence rapidly increased over the age of 60 years, with only 4% of the cases being under the age of 50 years. The rate for men (19.0 per 100,000, 95% CI: 16.1, 21.8) was 91% higher than that for women (9.9 per 100,000, 95% CI: 7.6, 12.2). The age- and gender-adjusted rate per 100,000 was highest among Hispanics (16.6, 95% CI: 12.0, 21.3), followed by non-Hispanic Whites (13.6, 95% CI: 11.5, 15.7), Asians (11.3, 95% CI: 7.2, 15.3), and Blacks (10.2, 95% CI: 6.4, 14.0). These data suggest that the incidence of Parkinson’s disease varies by race/ethnicity.},

Method: Speech response latency, interarticulatory coordinative consistency, accuracy of speech production, and response latency and accuracy on a receptive language task were analyzed in 16 individuals with PD and 16 matched control participants. ] Results: Individuals with PD had higher oral motor coordination variability, took a longer time to initiate speech, and made more errors on the speaking task compared with the control group. They also received lower scores on the 2 complex conditions of the receptive language task. Increased length and syntactic complexity negatively affected performance in both groups of speakers. Conclusions: These findings provide a novel window into the speech deficits associated with PD by examining performance on onger, sentence-level utterances in contrast to earlier investigations of single-word or nonword productions. Speech motor control processes and language comprehension were adversely affected in the majority of our participants with mild to moderate PD compared to the control group. Finally, increased syntactic complexity and sentence length affected both the healthy aging and PD groups’ speech production performance at the behavioral and kinematic levels.},

E a esta nova cultura de aprendizagem ampliada no ambiente tecnológico, reproduzindo ambientes da própria sociedade, proporciona um grande leque de opções e inovações, e culmina na ruptura dos paradigmas convencionais de ensino [Valente, 1999]. Porém, existe grande resistência na incorporação de mudanças no âmbito educacional, segundo Moran [2005] a escola é uma instituição mais tradicional que inovadora, e assim sendo mudar a cultura escolar é uma tarefa mais árdua que mudar a cultura de uma sociedade.

Desde então, tais jogos vêm evoluindo e ganhando espaço em muitas áreas do conhecimento com o propósito de auxiliar, treinar e informar ao mesmo tempo em que busca entreter, de tal forma que muitos pesquisadores definem o domínio na qual se inserem como “edutainment”, uma aglutinação das palavras educational e entertainment [Rapeepisam et al., 2006]. Ainda que existam controvérsias sobre seus benefícios para fins educacionais os serious games vêm sendo utilizados com mais freqüência para esse fim, por possuírem propósito educacional explícito ao promover a vinculação entre o lúdico e o caráter afetivo dos usuários com os ambientes de aprendizagem Mas, de acordo com Wang [2005], existem três pilares fundamentais para o sucesso na utilização dos jogos no âmbito escolar, e que sem esses a experiência educacional com o uso de jogos dificilmente podem gerar resultados satisfatórios. - Primeiro pilar: Exige educadores preparados, já que os alunos estão prontos para o ensino por meio de elementos de multimídia, mas os professores, em geral, não [Moran, 2005]; - Segundo pilar: Requer uma estrutura escolar e planejamento adequados, já que os professores sabem que precisam mudar, mas não sabem bem como fazê-lo e não estão preparados para experimentar com segurança. E em muitos casos é exigido destes tais mudanças sem dar-lhes as condições necessárias para que eles as efetuem [Moran, 2005]; - Terceiro pilar: Se refere à variedade e qualidade de jogos à disposição que possibilitem escolhas adequadas. Ao fazer este paralelo, deve-se levar em conta que os aprendizes assistem ao vídeo uma única vez, e toda a sua informação é transmitida em apenas uma sessão, enquanto o jogo entrega uma quantidade limitada de informações e oferece ao jogador a opção de repetir cada sessão inúmeras vezes, tendo em vista que os jogadores raramente irão jogar um videogame de sucesso apenas uma vez, sendo esta característica que o diferencia de outros meios de comunicação [Lieberman, 2001]. Stenberg [2000] foca do modo como as pessoas percebem, aprendem, recordam e pensam sobre a informação: - Teoria Construtivista - Teoria Sócio-Cultural - Teoria da Inclusção - Aprendizagem baseada em problemas E, apesar de se fazerem importantes, a análise do processo de cognição dos indivíduos e das abordagens pedagógicas mais adequadas, estas são per si insuficientes para garantir a aceitação do produto final de software, pois este envolve muitos fatores independentes (e.g. usabilidade, ergonomia) O autor baseasdo nas técnicas de engenharia de software e de game design, propõe a execução de um processo de desenvolvimento que comece com a elicita~~ao do que deve ser aprendido, ponha em prática as regras de game design e faça a avaliação ergonométrica do jogo na fase final. Estudo de Caso: O jogo “salve a cidade”, dá enfoque sobre os principais problemas ambientais que assolam a sociedade atual. O usuário se projeta no jogo, para realizar tarefas que irão solucionar problemas específicos nos mais variados cenários (aprendizagem baseada em problemas), o autor levou em consideração a teoria de vigotsky para desenvolver o jogo a partir da faixa etária. Interface de Jogo: A interface foi elaborada de acordo com a divisão que alguns autores como Bethke [2003], Clua e Bittencourt [2005] fazem em jogos: (i) interface out-game e (ii) in-game. A interface out-game é referente aos menus presentes fora do jogo, como o menu inicial, novo jogo e opções, já a interface in-game é aquela que exibe informações sobre o usuário em tempo de jogo como inventário e missões, tanto em andamento, como as concluídas. A aparência da aplicação foi elaborada levando-se em conta o uso de metáforas em interfaces [Lévy, 2000; Braga, 2004] para tornar o jogo o mais intuitivo possível.},

  Abstract                 = {Today, ubiquitous devices lack many of the security features known in desktop computing, an industry that is known to have a plethora of security problems. As ubiquitous devices are increasingly applied in the health care industry, security aspects need to receive even more attention. Clearly, patient-related data is extremely sensitive and legal requirements (such as HIPAA) attempt to enforce strict privacy controls. While we cannot solve the overall problem, our proposal to use RFID tags to authenticate users with ubiquitous devices addresses one of the most fundamental requirements of all security mechanisms: to reliably establish the user’s identity. In this paper we discuss some questions that raised during experiments with ubiquitous devices at Graz University Hospital. The main problems which could be identified included security and privacy issues (protection precautions, confidentiality, reliability, sociability). The experiments showed that new and emerging computer technologies such as mobile, ubiquitous and pervasive computing have an enormous potential for the improvement of manifold workflows in health care, however, psychological and technological research must be carried out together in order to bring clear benefits for the end-users and to optimize workflows in health care in the daily routine.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a software program (iGAIT) developed in MATLAB, for the analysis of gait patterns extracted from accelerometer recordings. iGAIT provides a user-friendly graphical interface to display and analyse gait acceleration data recorded by an accelerometer attached to the lower back of subjects. The core function of iGAIT is gait feature extraction, which can be used to derive 31 features from acceleration data, including 6 spatio-temporal features, 7 regularity and symmetry features, and 18 spectral features. Features extracted are summarised and displayed on screen, as well as an option to be stored in text files for further review or analysis if required. Another unique feature of iGAIT is that it provides interactive functionality allowing users to manually adjust the analysis process according to their requirements. The system has been tested under Window XP, Vista and Window 7 using three different types of accelerometer data. It is designed for analysis of accelerometer data recorded with sample frequencies ranging from 5&#xa0;Hz to 200&#xa0;Hz. },

One major challenge lies in the inherent complexity of human body movements and the variety of styles when people perform a certain activity. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we present a novel human activity recognition framework based on recently developed compressed sensing and sparse representation theory using wearable inertial sensors. Our approach represents human activity signals as a sparse linear combination of activity signals from all activity classes in the training set. The class membership of the activity signal is determined by solving a l1 minimization problem. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our sparse representation-based approach by recognizing nine most common human daily activities performed by 14 subjects. Our approach achieves a maximum recognition rate of 96.1%, which beats conventional methods based on nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, and support vector machine by as much as 6.7%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by using random projection, the task of looking for “optimal features” to achieve the best activity recognition performance is less important within our framework.},

  Review                   = {A Wearable computing consiste num sistema de computação móvel com as seguintes características: em constante operação A computação vestida (WearComp) não possui uma definição ainda, segundo o Prof Mann \cite{rohtua} da Universidade de Toronto esses sistemas possuem as seguintes características: estão presentes ou vestidas ao corpo humano e estão em constante operação monitorando a fisiologia do paciente através de sensores. A computação vestida com a computação ubíqua torna possível uma avalição clínica do paciente sem precedentes, provendo um serviço médico personalizado em qualquer momento e a qualquer lugar. Metodologia ------------------- É apresentado um modelo conceitual de 5 camadas (plataforma de hardware, sistema operacional, conexão de rede, middleware e aplicação). 1. Plataforma de Hardware A plataforma de hardware é responsável por coletar os parâmetros vitais do paciente, que consiste de um sensor médico e um atuador, MCU, além de uma unidade de armazenamento e um dispositivo de saída. Para satisfazer a portabilidade e os requisitos de conforto, os sensores e atuadores precisam ser miniaturizados e consumirem pouca energia. Atualmente os dados coletados são: pressão sanguínea, pulso cardíaco, açucar, eletrocardiograma (ecg), temperatura corporal, peso, cintura, saturação de oxigênio e eletroencefalograma (EEG). Os dispositivos de saída geralmente são módulos de comunicação wireless ou a fio. 2. Sistema Operacional O processamento dos dados em tempo-real requer um sistema operacional para a computação vestida reuer eficiência e leveza. Desenvolver um sistema operacional para essa plataforma tem sido levado em consideração, apesar de alguns sistemas fazerem uso do Windows CE ou variações do linux. Pesquisadores da UC Berkley exploram um novo sistema operacional especialmente desenvolvido para a Wearcomp denominado TinyOS. Esse sistema leva vantagem em algumas tecnologias existentes como: infraestrutura de software para execução de threads, mensagens ativas, direcionada a eventos e programação orientada a componentes. 3. Comunicação de Rede A troca de dados deve ser realizada através da conexão de rede. Do ponto de vista de execução a computação vestida se adequa mais as redes wirelesse e dispositivos como Bluetooth, Zigbee/IEEE 802.15.4 e conectores UWB. Além de conexão GPRS com internet para transmitir os dados remotamente para os médicos. 4.Middleware A principal função de um middleware é fazer quem que os componentes e sensores colaborem entre si. A estrutura de um middleware para a computação ubíqua vestida permite gerenciar provendo uma insfraestrutura de comunicação através de software. O objetivo principal do middleware para computação vestida é prover que os sensores possam enviar seus dados para a unidade de armazenada para serem avaliados em um outro momento. 5. Aplicação Os sistemas de computação vestida são dinâmicos e permite que o médico monitore e diagnostique o paciente através da rede. Pode ser aplicado em diversos contextos. Medical sensors in wireless personal area network(WPAN) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Os sensores medicos WPAN atualmente estão usando os padrões Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1), UWB(IEEE 802.15.3) e Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4). Transmissão de dados do Pocket PC. Consiste de um gerenciador de informações pessoais, coletando os dados e comunicando. - Os dados colecionados e a comunicação é realizada através de senroes médicos WPAN. - O gerenciamento de arquivos realiza o armazenamento localmente evitando que os dados sejam perdidos quando a comunicação falha. - Sistema de gerenciamento da saúde que permite feedback, prescrição médica, recomendação de dieta, conselhos de exercício através de SMS. Esse sistema é útil na troca remota de infromações no processo de diagnóstico e consulta. - Sistema de suporte que permite que a informação esteja disponível durante o diagnóstico. Centro de Serviço de Monitoramento --------------------------------------------------------- O centro de monitoramento deve ser responsável em convergir o armazenamento com o processamento dos dados e isso é realizado através dos seguintes serviços: - Registros eletrônico de saúde: que provê todo o histórico clínico do paciente. - Sistema de supporte a decisão médica (SSDM) que auxilia no diagnóstico - Sistema de suporte médico que pode através da análise dos dados armazenados (tratamento medicação). É necessário apoio suplementar nas evidências médicas no sistema de informações clínicas. - Sistema de Feedback - Body Area Network ----------------------------- Uma BAN é uma rede composta dos diferentes tipos de componentes computacionais distribuídos no corpo. O Ban é um sistema vestido usado para obetr, analisar e processar os sinais vitais, que são cruciais para sistemas de saúde móveis. Vestido ou implantado os sensores são conectados via rede e fazem a troca dos dados através da BAN. Buscando satisfazer a limitação dos recursos, A ban faz uso dos protocolos de rede.},

author = {Nikolas Rose},
journal = {Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences},
volume = {77},

abstract = {Abstract A new paradigm for medical care is emerging which terms itself “personalized medicine”. Advocates claim that medical treatment can now be targeted on the specific characteristics of each individual, using genetic profiling to identify the particular nature of the condition, and to tailor treatments for each person. Further, they argue, the focus of medicine will move from treatment to prevention. It is claimed that genetic tests based on recent genomic research will enable doctors to identify susceptibilities for such common conditions before the onset of illness, and to target preventive intervention to reduce the individual and social burdens of ill health. Further, it is argued that genetic information will allow precision in the choice of drugs and doses, avoiding adverse reactions, minimising waste, reducing costs and increasing efficacy. Coupled with other advances, it is argued that the future of medicine should and will be “personalised, predictive and preventive.” Drawing on such developments, we have seen the growth of personal genomics companies marketing tests “direct to consumers” that claim to identify individual disease susceptibilities and to “empower” individuals by giving them the information—and the personal responsibility—to manage their own health. This paper critically assesses the promises made for personalized medicine, discusses some of the challenges for health policy, and considers the social and ethical implications of moving medical care towards such a personalized and individualized model. }
